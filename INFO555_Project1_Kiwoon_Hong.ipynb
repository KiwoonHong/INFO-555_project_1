I looked at a number of Avalons but did not want to spend over $10K for a lower mileage one because I drive over 30K miles per year.  I bought this specific car thinking that I might drive it for a year while I looked for another LS430.  I love the handling and comfort of this car. It does not ride as soft as the LS but it easier to drive because it just soaks up the miles without much steering correction.  I tried the Limited model first but found the cooled seats were not as comfortable as those without this feature.  I specifically looked for a model that did NOT have the sunroof as this feature limits headroom (I\\'m 6\\'2\") and need the extra 3\" or so that models without the sunroom have.  I have put a new battery and brakes on this car.  Those have been the only repairs in 100K miles.  No check engine lights.  No weird noises.  Great acceleration.  This is a roomy car with a huge back seat.  It\\'s not fair to compare with the LS 430 that costs twice as much but there are some areas that seem to not be as nice-like the trunk carpet and trim.  Overall, this has been a great used car for us-I would purchase again and recommend to anyone looking for a large dependable sedan.  Because everyone wants an SUV these tend to be lower priced on the used market (compared to SUV\\'s) and make a great buy for people looking for reasonable transportation.',\n",

Over $10k repairs for this & replacing the catalytic converter, and the mechanics said 4) it desperately needed a \"system update\" which had it in the shop an extra 3 days. 5) The USB port went out right away.

The thing is a gas hog and JEEPS and other full-sized trucks get better MPG. Absolute total JUNKB. The so-called new Electric Transmission B.S. -   Absolute JUNK - it shifts weird, it is slow (okay I guess, if you are an old man or old woman that loves to cruse at about 30 mph. HORRIBLE - and I absolutely despise it.C. Software onboard - absolutely TERRIBLE. THe GPS lags, it is NOT user friendly and they don't use Android or Apple iOS friendly software so, you have to get used to their CRAPPY TOYOTA SOFTWARE. Bloat/Junkware is what it is.D. Drive - the Drive - Feels like a LINCOLN or a Cadillac. Might be okay if again: you are an 80 year old man or woman that loves the feel of a slow, squooshy cadillac that feels top heavy and bouncy. Absolutely a TERRIBLE drive and feel to it.E. Handling - The steering wheel feels like that of a big TRACTOR. Reminds me of when I was back on the farm, in IOWA... Loose steering, you can't take your eyes of the road for a split second or you are swearving into the other lane or onto a curb...F. Oh, and only one door handle unlocks the truck...

              " \" I went to trade in my 2001 Ford Explorer for a more fuel efficient vehicle. The dealership showed me was the 2012 Nissan Versa SV Sedan with the CVT transmission. I loved the look of the car, the price was alright, mileage was great, and as I test drove it around the block it seemed to drive wonderfully. The day after I purchased the Versa, I noticed when driving it was acting funny. As I was accelerating, it acted like it didn't want to go. It lagged terribly and made this odd noise under the hood. I immediately took it to the dealership and asked them to please drive it because it seemed something was wrong. They told me that it was because I was not custom to driving with a CVT transmisson and sent me on. The same thing continued and I kept telling myself I needed to just get used to driving it. A couple months go by and I begin to notice when I am parked or sitting at a light, the entire car will vibrate all over along with this rattle noise. I took it to the dealership and told them about the issues during my service appointment and they gave me the same run around. So I let it go to see if maybe I was still freaking out for no reason. A few more months go by and the acceleration was getting worse and worse. It got to where it took about 3 to 5 seconds for the car to accelerate from a stop, the vibration when idle became worse and louder, and a loud hum noise began to come from the car. I had my service due in a few weeks so I was going to mention it all again then but my visits became early. As I was accelerating from a two-way stop (I was at the stop sign). I saw to my right that nothing was coming and to my left, there was an 18 wheeler coming. I had more than enough time to go on and go. As I did, my car stalled as usual and shut off completely in the middle of the intersection causing the 18 wheeler to drive into the ditch!!! No one was hurt thankfully but it was dangerous! I immediately the nex day went straight to the dealership and told them something had t be done! I wanted a trade in and they wouldn't do this. They suggested fixing the transmission (finally). I was given a rental car for the three weeks it took them to replace my transmission with a new one (@ 74,000 miles). This past Thursday afternoon (3/23/17) I was told my car was ready to be picked up. I went up there to pick it up and immediately as I drive out of the dealership, I notice that the vibration is still there, the humming noise, the brakes acted like they didn't want to work (jerking motion), and the acceleration is better but not perfect. I called my mother and told her that the car is still doing the same things and that I am going back up there tomorrow (Friday... 3/24/17). My mother and I went up there the next morning very angry and upset telling them the same things were still happening and everyone seemed to be getting pissed with us. We were told that the transmission had been fixed and nothing is wrong with my car. I was told that it was in my head and I was worrying for no reason. I overheard a salesman say that we were just looking to trade because I wanted a new car. I had a technician drive the car with me because they suggested him to do so. However, no one would listen to me and drive the car longer than 2 mins around the block. You had to drive it about ten minutes to start to hear the humming sound and feel the vibrations. I became very upset and left because we were just getting the run around AGAIN! Well, as I am driving the rest of the day, the hum noise becomes worse and worse! At about 11:30 pm that Friday night, I am driving home from clinicals and not even a mile from my house, I begin to hear an awful clanking noise coming from under the car and I could feel it in the floorboard. I thought it would be okay til I get home because I was so close. I had one stop sign to stop at before getting to my house. As I accelerate from the stop sign, the hum and clank noise become louder and louder and I notice my car is veering the right. No matter how much I turn my steering wheel to the left, it will not go to the left. I immediately try to brake and the car acts like it does not want to brake. It jerks and is still going to the right. I get down to about 20 miles per hour and I am going off onto the side of the road and finally, I stop by hitting a speed limit sign! I called my mother freaking out asking her to come down the road. We called the sheriff department and wrecker service to come out there. I didn't turn the car off when I got out just because I didn't think about it. As my mother and I are standing out there waiting for them to arrive, we start to hear this loud fan type noise coming from under the hood and see a slight glimpse of smoke. We immediately turned the car off! Now, my car is at the body shop and we are going to the dealership first thing when they open on Monday! PLEASE DO NOT BUY A VERSA!!!!!! I am not the only person I know who has had this type of issue go on with their Versa.\",\n",

Platinum series, fully loaded, only 25k miles, but $35,000 worth of heartache. Roughly 120 miles into our trip, the car began shuttering at low speeds. When we stopped to refuel 400 miles into our trip, the transmission wouldn\\'t engage when my husband put the car in \"Drive.\" After repeated attempts he finally got the transmission to engage and we were able to \"limp it\" to the nearest Auto Nation dealer and sit and wait 4 hours for them to open. However, because it is Sunday, the service department is closed. The Atlanta location offered to reimburse me for either a modest (not comparable) rental or a hotel while we wait for an indefinite period of time for our vehicle to be looked at and a determination to be made from there - a kind gesture but hardly the consideration I\\'d expect given the circumstances and the capabilities of a multimillion dollar netting corporation.

Second year, A/C compressor was replaced and transmission completely failed on me and was replaced (under warranty, thank god). I\\'m approaching the end of the second year and the transmission may need replacing again. Electrical system is complete crud. And headlights flicker when i drive over the slightest bump. All lamps are loose. I especially regret paying an additional $1000 for the infotainment system because it often doesn\\'t recognize that my phone is connected so i cant play my music or speak on the phone over the speakers. Rear view camera is great when im backing into parking spaces but it tends to glitch like a television using an antenna in the middle of a hurricane. Also, compared to the rear view camera in a 2009 Maxima, the picture quality is bad and almost useless after sundown. The \\'09 Maxima was very clear and vibrant in color both night and day. The rear view camera is used to determine whether there is someone in your blind spot and i can honestly say that it was wrong 40% of the time. It is also used to determine whether you\\'re too close to the center lines so that it can alert you. This feature is called \"Lane Departure Warning\" and often didn\\'t work either. A minor complaint would be that any time i have a passenger get out of the car, they have a hard time shutting the door on the first try. You practically have to slam them shut. The horn is weak, sucks if you\\'re a honker like me haha. Navigation system always had a false ETA. For example, last night my ETA was 12:26 but the time was 12:53.

It worked for a couple years and I started to look at upgrading the seats, stereo, rims, etc.; however, at 75k miles, I replaced the struts and lower control arms.

A simple safey bulletin warning consumers of \"known\" deadzones where the key transponder does not consistently work (cup holder/trunk, per Nissan Corporate Office) would be much appreciated and is the right information to share with consumers for their safety.

Two weeks ago my check engine and TRC OFF lights came on so I rushed to a nearby Toyota dealership an hour later the service tech approached me to explain that my secondary air injection valves were closed reason why my truck would only get up to 40mph and felt bogged down. He then informed me it could be a matter of resetting the computer and the valves could reset themselves and I will just be out $100.00 for the computer testing. Or my air injection valve assembly could be bad. Another hour later he returns to tell me resetting the computer did not work and I would need to replace the air injection valves if I got it repaired there and right away it would be $2,500.00 if not $2,800.00.

Feels like the gear slipped (engine whines, but no acceleration) then exerted a big gear kick.  3.\\tI noticed that while I turn left on curve road (in the neighborhood) around 15-20 mph, the gear stutters a little bit, enough to feel like the wheel hits loose gravels.4.\\tIn general, it appears the engine whines a lot when accelerating from stop.

Apparently Nissan KNOWS there's troubles with their transmissions but they've done nothing about it. Do yourself a favor and just say no. Won't ever buy a Nissan again. And I'm ready to tell the whole world.\",\n",

I\\'ve only owned my car for 30 days and already had an issue with the car starting on its own.  Yes!  That\\'s right.  I walked up to my car after shopping at WalMart for 40 min. only to find that it had started up by itself, and must have been running while I was in the store with the doors locked.  Upon entering the car, a yellow caution light was flashing near the odometer.  I read many consumer complaints and found another person complaining of the same problem and was told that it can happen when the remote entry keypad is pushed twice after exiting the vehicle.  After reading many other customer complaints about various issues with 2013-2015 brakes not working while driving (Yikes!), driver doors not unlocking, and front seats making loud noises while driving, I wish I had read those complaints before purchasing this vehicle.  It sounds like the 2013, 2014, and 2015 may be lemons.  I\\'m not sure about the 2016 yet, because the car is too new to know for sure, but I\\'m very concerned about what\\'s to come.  I don\\'t feel 100% safe in this car, especially since I have 2 kids.  This is my 2nd Toyota.  I just sold my 2006 Sienna minivan and it had many defective issues/recalls.  I will not be buying a Toyota in the future because they don\\'t stand behind their cars.  They only try to blame the customer for their defects.UPDATE after 30 days of driving - The sound system is terrible.  My Sienna minivan had a JBL sound system which was great, but the Highlander has a cheap sound system with a horrible muffled sound.  After driving the car a little while, you will notice that the interior has many cheap parts!!  The floor \"carpet\" is actually felt, not carpet, and some of the dash has plastic parts.  The front seats and angled headrest are very uncomfortable on longer rides.  Wish I could trade my new XLE in for a well made car that matches the price I paid.  The quality just isn\\'t in the 2016 Highlander for the high price.   Still disappointed.',\n",

Good gas mileage (Nissan claims it to be 33 on highways and 26 on city roads)2. Additional seat for occasional usage of my family needsEver since I bought this car I am getting very low gas mileage and tried to work with local dealer as well as Nissan for resolution but no satisfactory results-1. I am getting ~ 19 MPG in city driving and getting 24-26 MPG on highway driving which is about 8 MPG lower than what is claimed at the time vehicle is sold or advertised.2. Multiple visits to dealer and gave them gas mileage readings as per their requirements. Dealer did software upgrade but I don't see they did anything reasonable which convince that it should make it better. After multiple visits and fulfilling whatever they asked for (even waiting for more then 4-5 Hrs. in one occasion) no outcome and dealer asked me to call Nissan customer care.3. I called Nissan customer care and got Case opened but here also it was completely unsatisfactory4. Nissan representative told me that based on dealer checks, everything is working as expected and after lot of persuasion she agreed that her supervisor will call5. Supervisor called me and she told me the same story that as per dealer it is within company specifications. when asked what are company specifications and this is lower than what you advertise, no answer and keep on repeating that this is within company specifications. This was completely unacceptable and no help provided by Nissan and after I told that I have to go to Better Business Bureau, she had no effect. Seems Nissan is very proud of their legal team and a mere customer can't do anything against them. So if you are buying any Nissan vehicle and you are unlucky to get a bad vehicle, my experience is that both Dealer and Nissan will leave you to deal with it.I would recommend to not go with Nissan or Cherry Hill Nissan dealership.\",\n",

I bought a 2009 limited V6 3.5 and it is a nightmare. The suspension recall fix involves an epoxy seal on the links which make the adjustable links...unadjustable. meaning...if the rear is out of alignment. ..you have to pay $500+ to have the recall fix done again. I have never had to do anything other than maintenance to my toyotas. This one...3rd pair of shocks...this time i used monroe shocks. ER brake cable...drive train assembly  ($1400 part). Blower motor...Such a disappointment... I have 150000 miles on the odometer and it runs great. Done with it.After I updated my review I started experience more problems with this car. I had to have the rotors resurfaced again.  Problems with the steering also started to progress. Recalls for the master switch for driver's side window and wiper motor. Toyota stopped making their own parts in 2006...huge mistake. This car became a full time job. I am a car guru and visit dealerships 24/7 chose to get rid of this car before it depreciated any more. I had a hard time finding a dealership that would give me decent money for the trade. The day I traded in the 2009 my 2005 limited (not a v6 and a lot less options) was worth 2000.00 more. I have to say that I am disappointed in the Toyota Corporation. Their business decisions have affected their automobiles. Putting their dealerships in the position of not being able to be honest with customers about their cars has enabled me not to trust Toyota corporation anymore. I was fortunate to be able to put my car up on a rack anytime I needed to check anything. Many people don't have that luxury. I see people driving their cars on the road with the suspension recall and the rear wheels out of toe. ..scary. If I get the opportunity to talk to them most say that they did not know because they had the recall fix done! I take excellent care of my cars...it's a lemon.Since the last time I reviewed this car I look at the rear suspension of other 2009 rav4 cars on the road or parking lots. I have not found one yet that the rear wheels are not out out of toe. I even speak to other owners and inform them about this make and model. This car has a lot of safety issues. Why Toyota thinks it is OK to drive a car around with the rear wheels out of toe is beyond me.

We test drove a 3rd gen Tacoma at the local dealership, which after a 20 mile trip decided the truck would be a pretty good replacement for us empty nesters. Good mpg, reliability etc.. Totally drank the Kool Aid. We ordered our TRD-OR 4 dr lb and waited 4 months for it to arrive. We took our first trip- a camping trip that took us over the divide to south western Montana. Not a ton of gear- lightly loaded I would say. We were SHOCKED that to climb the grade the tranny dropped to 4the and 3rd gear, and it redlined the entire uphill climb! Our 100 mile trip to the campsite returned a whopping 16mpg. Stock truck, mostly highway and then 10 offroad. My offroad mpg was better then the highway.  That should have been a sign. Then the tranny starting shifting erratically, up-down, up-down.. It would never hold a gear. Took it to the dealer to perform the TSB update on the tranny- service department at first said \"No TSB exists\". I had to do an internet search and show it to them. TSB flash fixed it for about 500 miles, then it reverted back to erratic shifting. Also- dealer said mpg\\'s \"Will get better after 2,000 miles or so\".. Third problem- the hood support braces are glued to the hood. 75% of the glue points failed, and my truck had a wavy hood at highway speed. If the sun glint was just right, it was like having a disco ball in the cab. Very annoying. Fourth problem- after 6 months and 14,000 miles the truck differential started howling and moaning. At this point the avg MPG was 16 (yes- 16), even after a long highway trip from Montana to Ohio. The dealer refused to address the hood- they said \"Normal Characteristic of the truck\", my tranny still shifted erratically and the car was unsuited for long distance travel. We had it. We drove over to the Chevy dealer, test drove a 1500 Silverado with a 6.2L V8 and 8spd tranny and got a decent trade on the Tacoma. No shifting issues, no wavy hood, no groaning differential and I\\'m getting 19mpg on average. Toyota really duffed this Tacoma. Not worth the hype, the price or the hassle.',\n",

Within the second month of leasing this car, we found the Mirai leaking coolant onto our garage floor. Upon taking it to the dealership, we discovered that a pebble from the road went through the front grill and bust a hole in our coolant tank, causing this issue. The design bug is likely due to the way that the Mirai takes in air from the front grill to supply the fuel cell with oxygen, exposing many of the internal components to the external environment. The worst thing about this issue is how Toyota decided to resolve it: refusing to acknowledge their design mistake, forcing us to pay $3000-4000 for the repair (to pay for their liquid gold coolant), since their own design mistakes are apparently not covered by the warranty with the car. And on top of the insulting response from them, they are able to offer no guarantee of fixing this problem in the design, which means the car is still unprotected from any stone on the road. Our dealership has told us that several other customers (with the 2018 Mirai) have come in with the same issue, meaning that this is a widespread problem. Avoid this car, if possible.\",\n",

Toyota can\\'t seem to get to the bottom of this matter. In the interim I am very frustrated as I am getting the run around between the manufacturer and the dealer. I plan on pursuing NJ Lemon Law in attempt to have my car replaced.After pursuing Lemon law and having my car inspected by a Toyota Corporate mechanic I was told that the issue is due to a faulty design in the fuel tank. When my car is parked even on a slight incline (in my driveway) with a full tank of gas, gas will leak out and compromise the charcoal canister. When the onboard computer system senses that there is a issue with the fuel system, it is designed to automatically shut the car as a safety precaution \"even while the vehicle is in motion\". Toyota then advised me not to fill my tank more then half until a solution to this problem is remedied.  I was told that all 2012, 2013 and 2014 Toyota Camry\\'s (along with some other Toyota models) have the same faulty design in the tank.  As such, getting me into another  2013 or 2014 vehicle would not solve the problem. My claim was therefore denied. I am currently eagerly waiting for a class action suit against Toyota. I have since gotten rid of my Camry and purchased a 2014 Honda Accord. As miserable as I was with the Camry, that\\'s how much I am truly loving my Accord! My negative experience with Toyota has and continues to spread and have an impact. I have since convinced many coworkers, friends and family members (many who have been long time loyal Toyota customers)  to switch over to the new Honda Accord. They too all seem \"thrilled\" with their Accord. The overall feedback I get is that the car is a much smoother drive, hugs the road much better specifically in inclement weather conditions. The also enjoy the plush interior design which makes the car feel very homey (vs. Toyota\\'s cheap interior and hard plastic feel and design), along with dual climate control and better fuel economy. The Accord also includes numerous safety features even in the lx (base) models, (which Toyota doesn\\'t even offer as a upgrade) including hill assist. If you are in the market for purchasing a sedan do yourself a favor and test drive the Accord before even considering the Camry.

Toyota has gotten incredibly shifty about their warranties and their reliability has dropped. I am reviewing this car based on owning it and also based on working on the brand professionally. In the year that I bought this car used, my dashboard has melted and been replaced by Toyota under warranty. My engine burns 1.5 quarts of oil per 12,000 miles due to faulty piston ring design. They will not cover it due to a lack of oil change receipts and the nature of it being purchased used. The gas pedal had a recall that was performed due to it functioning incorrectly. All Toyota Water pumps will leak antifreeze which is considered normal by the manufacturer. The sun visor in this particular model is held up by a metal clip and actually mine fell down while I was driving on the interstate one day. My radio was designed without the JBL option and you cannot upgrade after you purchase your vehicle. The wiring harnesses are not included and they will not allow it to be performed. The radio I was stuck with has major issues - as do many of them on that model. The cd players don't read properly and I went through five of them both new and used. You will be unable to do anything other than upgrade to an aftermarket radio designed specifically for this vehicle. The interior design of this build was built incredibly cheap and lacks durability in all senses. The alignment of the drivers seat is off to the right so eventually you will notice the left side of your seat wear out. The air conditioning system has a bad habit of growing mold and smelling like death due to evaporator moisture. Toyota's legendary paint has once again failed on my vehicle. The clear coat is paper thin and scratching everywhere. Also in newer vehicles, you will find stone chips and rail marks on every single car, even new ones. Trade in value has dropped horribly with this model and I'm financially underwater on this transaction. Toyota factory strut mounts are notorious for failure - especially the drivers side front on this model. The drivers side axle is also an issue and has a tendency to make noise and fail. The transmission software on these cars has been flashed several thousand times due to bad programming decisions and hesitations. Every time the car is at the shop there is a new recall open on it.

In doing more research I have learned that unless a certified Nissan mechanic diagnosis the issue they(consumer affairs) cant or wont(not sure) do anything for me. Furthermore, the part is the size of a deck cards and riveted so I cant replace the part myself.

And please, read this if you are considering purchasing one and this tip to do on the test drive.  I purchased my 2016 Crewmax new and at about 1,000 miles the truck started vibrating at approximately 48-50 mph when it was in 6th gear (overdrive).  The Tundra is a 6 speed automatic (overdrive).  I took it to the dealer I purchased it from and the mechanic diagnosed and verified my problem.  This is where the problems begin.  He then got on the phone to \"Toyota Tech Line\" and they had him \"move the tires around\", which he did.  Bottom line.  It didn\\'t fix the vibration around 48-50 mph.  So I met with the \"regional corporate dude\" who went for a ride with me and he even verified the issue but said that the \"new one\" we drove on the lot did it worse so it was classified as \"characteristic\".  What???  Worse than  mine??  That my friends is \"corporate speak\" for \"blow off\" / \"cover up\".  So, I took it to another Toyota Dealer and had the mechanic go for a ride.  He verified and diagnosed that I had a problem.  He even took his laptop computer on a ride after speaking to the Toyota Tech Line and they said to hit the button on his laptop computer every time he felt the problem.  He came back and told me he \"hit the button\" over 100 times.  Thus..  Houston, we have a problem verified by 2 Toyota mechanics and the \"regional dude\".  I am heading back for one more time to attempt to get it fixed.  The problem is actually getting worse.  I currently have about 8,000 miles on my truck.  As I stated earlier, I am a complete \"Toyota Fan Boy\", but the sheer and utter disrespect shown not only to me, but the Toyota Certified Mechanics who are working hard and wanting to fix the problem shown by the \"corporate regional guy\" is unacceptable and something I would expect from GM, Ford, or Chrysler.  But Toyota.... No way.  I know they try to \"care\" about their customers, but with the way I have been \"jerked around\" and humiliated by the \"corporate regional guy\" has taken its toll.  I guess that\\'s why God created \"Lemon Law Attorneys\".  So, PLEASE READ THIS.....  IF YOU ARE THINKING OF BUYING A TOYOTA TUNDRA, PLEASE, ON YOUR TEST RIDE, GO APPROX. 48-50 MPH AND LET IT BE IN 6TH GEAR AND HOLD IT THERE.  If you feel the vibration, RUN.  Know that they are not going to fix it and call it \"characteristic\".  If you can live with that, then so be it.  But, don\\'t say I didn\\'t try to inform and help you in this matter.  In fact, according to the 2 mechanics that worked on the truck, apparently there are more people than me \"squeaking\" about this problem.   It is a problem / issue!  Best wishes!UPDATE:  3/26/18:  I filed a \"Lemon Law\" suit and \"settled\" with Toyota and have since gotten rid of this 2016 Tundra.  I have purchased another 2018 Tundra.  Please be aware.  This 2018 is also doing the exact same thing as my 2016 did, but not quite as bad.  I am not mechanical but I know what I \"hear\" and \"feel\".  The Toyota factory trained technicians have stated it\\'s a torque converter issue and Toyota just won\\'t fix it and would rather fight you than fix it.

Paid $35000 for this piece of junk..... will never do business again with Toyota and advise others to beware of the terrible ownership experience.

              " ' This is the 4th Nissan I\\'ve owned. I stuck with them because I have loved my Nissans, and I am all about brand loyalty. My last (2013) Sentra was pretty great, so I decided to go the same route with this one. unfortunately, not only did the dealership stop being helpful once I signed that paper, (and at times were actually detrimental to the process, verging on rude and ignoring my requests to get my contract and financial paperwork (Which I don\\'t have 45 days later), leading me to miss my first payment) but this car is awful.  The navigation system turns off about 500 feet before my destination, leaving me to guess or impede traffic to try and see house/building numbers. The USB has to reload my USB drive (where I listen to all my music) every time the car starts, and skips the music as it \"index\"es 1-3% at a time (and sometimes doesn\\'t at all). Most of the time I reach my destination before I can actually enjoy any of my own music.  The dashboard is half pointless, as it took me almost an hour to figure out how to scroll through the settings list. The center console is half the size of my last one, but there\\'s a huge space between that and my cup holders- what a pointless design. The buttons on the steering wheel are tiny, leading me to question how those with large hands or fingers are able to hit one. EVERY TIME the temperature is under 40 degrees F, I get an Alert saying there are cold temperatures outside--underneath the temperature that is stationary. So if the winter temperatures affect the performance in my car so much that I get a warning about it...I LIVE IN NEW YORK, and am extremely disappointed. The acceleration makes my car sound like it wants to die and is working twice as hard as it should be (I am not a slam on the pedal type of person). The windshield wipers don\\'t lift up due to a design mistake- again- living in new York with ice and snow, this is a MAJOR flaw. Driving over 20 mph, my passengers side whistles and I feel like a dog listening to a high-pitched sound (I don\\'t know if it is the window? mirror? Having the window doesn\\'t change it or alter the noise, and I have to turn on music to be able to drive long distances without going crazy from the whistle. The blind spot notifications and back up cam are great- there was a big improvement over the 2013, and I love the pockets on the front of the seats. However I\\'m not joking when I say if I could turn it in now, I would. I hate this car, and I will never purchase another Nissan thanks to this experience, car, and the (and the previous for same attempt of purchase) dealership I worked with this year. After 11 years of owning Nissans (and another 3 in the future of leasing this POS), I\\'m upset about every single interaction that has taken place, on top of the car. If the car were great and the dealership sucked, whatever. This car is awful. I absolutely do not recommend it, and if you HAVE to get a Nissan, go for at least the Altima.',\n",
              " ' After owning nothing but Camrys since 1989, and being completely satisfied with them, we decided to \"upgrade\" to the Toyota \"Flagship\", assuming that it would be nicer than the Camrys.  This was the biggest car buying mistake of my life!  Our 2014 Avalon Limited has the harshest ride and the most road noise of any car we have ever owned.  We refer to it as \"The Turnip\" because we feel the ride and noise would be what you would expect from a turnip truck used on a farm to transport vegetables.  The seats are about as comfortable as sitting on a sheet of plywood.  Understand that we think the deep metallic red Avalon is one of the prettiest cars on the road.  We get a lot of compliments on the appearance of the car, and I always try to sell it to the people making the compliment.However, when new people ride in the car, the comment is something like, \"What were you thinking?  Did you even drive this thing before you bought it?\"  Regrettably, I didn\\'t drive the car; I went entirely on Toyota\\'s reputation for quality and the terrific Avalon reputation for a quiet, almost luxury car ride, in an affordable vehicle.Toyota says they redefined the ride to appeal to a younger (40-ish) group of potential buyers.  I really don\\'t see where a \"neck-snapping\" noisy ride would appeal to people in any age group.A few other complaints: 1. Navigation system is already out of date; 2. Analog and digital speed indications are different; 3. Rattles are starting to appear; 4. Sound system is very unimpressive compared to systems in our other cars. I have tried several times to trade this car for something (almost anything) else.  Car dealers KNOW the Avalon\\'s new reputation, and the trade-in value is below the low end of the Kelly Blue Book range of values.  The saddest event was when I test drove a Ford F-150 pickup truck and the ride quality and lack of road noise was FAR superior to the Avalon.Summary: If you feel you simply MUST consider this car, take it for an EXTENDED test drive before signing the paperwork!!  Drive down a highway at 60 MPH and just listen to the road noise!!  There doesn\\'t seem to be adequate sound insulation in the body.  READ READ READ the reviews!!!Better yet, buy something else.Update:  After trying several times, we have not been able to get rid of this car.  Dealers know that this is not the quiet comfortable car that Avalon used to be.  The car has very low mileage and is in absolutely flawless condition, but we have not been able to get within $2000 of KBB or NADA trade in value.  This car was a very poor choice.Update 2/17:  We still own this car because we have been unable to get any kind of a reasonable trade-in on the vehicle.  We keep the car as a spare when someone in the family needs a car when their car is in the shop, etc..  This is not a problem since we have four cars for two drivers.  We purchased a new all-wheel-drive SUV last November.  Sadly, the SUV rides far better than the Avalon and, unbelievably, is quieter.  The most annoying thing about this Avalon is that it could have been a wonderful car if they had only left it alone and kept the fantastic quiet comfortable ride for which Avalon was know up to the 2013 model.  I enjoy reading other Avalon reviews where the Avalon is compared to \"the Flintstone\\'s car with granite wheels\".  At least I get a couple laughs out of the $35000 I threw away on this car.Update 2/18:Because we refuse to take a financial beating on \"The Turnip\", we still own it.  We just couldn\\'t find a dealer, including Toyota, who would even give us the \"trade in\" value toward list price on another car.  We have two SUV\\'s that ride much better than the Avalon, and are much quieter.  The Avalon needed a complete 4-wheel brake job, including rotors, at 31,000 miles!  Never had a car before that required a brake job at such a low mileage (usually, we get 60,000 or more miles out of brakes).Again I will state that this could have been a wonderful car if Toyota maintained the quiet and excellent ride quality that it was known for before the 2013 model.  BTW, I bought a Subaru Outback for about 70% of the cost of the Avalon.  The Outback is a pure joy to own: better, quieter ride than the Avalon!  Shame on you, Toyota!!',\n",

I had to purchase a battery pack to get this thing to go on a regular basis. If I hadn't it wouldn't start. As a teenager, it took me many hours to be able to buy this hunk of junk for 2500. I have had this car for about 3 weeks and it died on me today. I can't express the frustration I am feeling right now. I was scammed by a dealership into buying a car that wouldn't even last me a month-- ridiculous. The dealership even lowered the odometer, so I'm not even sure exactly how many miles is on it.

              " \" !!AVOID THIS MODEL!!! - Backstory : Based on a good amount of research it was hard to deny the overall positive press this model was getting. I had a 2012 528i that was out of warranty and have had BMW’s since my early 20's so when the lease incentives hit bargain basement levels, I jumped in. Sadly, I should have remembered a life preserver.Month 1 - 2 weeks out of service - hybrid battery/charging system warningMonth 2 - 2 weeks out of service - hybrid battery/charging system warningMonth 3 - 2 days out of service - hybrid battery/cold weather use warning.So, 2.2 months, over a month out of service total. Great start to my ownership experience.However, it gets worse. We have had very cold temperatures over the last two weeks, even for where I live in Richmond, VA. Days and nights well below freezing. I get that batteries don’t retain full charge in cold weather, but this one was only charging about 80% max and depleted even that very quickly...that is...when it actually allowed for electric operation. You see, what they don’t tell you is that the fully battery operation is not available in lower temperatures! Yep, that’s right. So, for all you who, like me, thought you could pretty much commute via full battery, well....guess what, ya can’t when it is cold out! Sad part is, this is considered normal according to my dealership. What burns my ass up even more is that a warning light stays lit on your dash and on your Nav screen to remind you that you paid $$$$ for a system you can’t use.Other things they don’t tell you - - -This is a 320e at best. You are going to deplete your battery relatively quickly (14 miles max in full electric mode) and once depleted, guess what? You aren’t running on 248 advertised horsepower, you are running on 180....with several hundred pounds on top of a similar 320i model! Battery regeneration isn’t enough for spirited driving or even multiple full throttle launches back to back! So, BMW has pulled the wool over my eyes, just don’t let it do the same to you.Other things I have found out by myself - - -$575 for side window sun shades? WTH? They are MANUAL!$2650 for Blind Spot/Lane Departure/and Frontal Impact Warning and a front/rear parking camera/sensor system with around view camera? Have they lost their MINDS?!? Worse yet, all you are paying for is warning lights and a shake of the steering wheel! Ridiculous and a waste of money unless you live urban and park on the street.So, as of this writing BMW USA has contacted me because they know that the cold driving issues (no full electric power) are an issue along with the horsepower claims.  It should say 248 MAX hp, because it is rare that you have it to use.  I have asked them to take it back.  A little over two months of disappointment.\",\n",

It is very worthy of its 1.5 stars on car ratings, and we can't wait to pay it off and have it destroyed! But I do not agree with how we were treated at the Nissan dealership. I had to inform them to check the lines- because that seems to be the reoccurring issue. Yes, we called it before they did. We were told it happens when you drive it  too much; A Ford only lasts 4 yrs and a Sentra shouldn't be driven at all! Good thing we were properly educated in that. So, we left our car FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS, not offered a courtesy car,  BUT they did tell us they'd send a shuttle- they did not! We were NOT even called when it was ready, I did the courtesy of calling them. But they did manage to harass us in trying to trade in my crap car for a second crap car for only couple thousand more. Probably a total of 3000k in repairs. Ps my air conditioner is still not cold enough.

              " \" I have a 2011 Nissan Maxima which I bought brand new in November 2010. The CVT transmission shut down while driving! The car has only 53,146 miles and no other mechanical problems. I found out Nissan extended warranties on 2007-2010 select vehicles including the Maxima due to CVT transmission problems. My car was towed to Nissan early Monday morning. I was given a toll free number to corporate office for possible assistance on Tuesday and they kept my car through Friday before coming back to tell me they would not be assisting me. I asked what criteria was used to make that determination. The agent stated the same info I had given them on Tuesday morning, i.e., how many miles are on the vehicle, the warranty, etc. They had no intention of assisting. What a waste! It is all about the dollar. The car is cosmetic, just looks good, that's it! She said it was 15 months outside of warranty when in fact I bought an extended 6 year/100000 mile warranty from Nissan when I bought the car. The warranty expired 3 months ago in November 2016. They stated they did not see the warranty in their system and it must have been an outside warranty sold to me by Nissan. All CVT transmission cars should be recalled. It is like a ticking time bomb. They are waiting for something drastic to happen before being forced to recall. What a waste!\",\n",
              " \" I was looking for a small SUV/crossover type vehicle to replace my older real estate vehicle. After retiring from real estate I didn't need a large SUV, so I wanted something smaller. I found a nice looking 2003 Toyota Rav4 that seemed to fit my bill. It ran good, the interior was nice and it seemed like it would do me well. I should have read some of the one star reviews. If I had, I would have seen that this vehicle had a bad engine in it and that Toyota doesn't seem to care. The engine has a design defect that caused the head bolts in the back of the engine to pull up and strip the threads in the engine block. Fixing the problem means replacing the engine at a cost of at least $3000. I live on a fixed income now and I don't have that kind of money laying around. I can't drive the car any more than 100 miles without stopping, letting it cool down and putting some water in it. So basically, I'm stuck near home. I wouldn't dream of taking this car on the road. The problem with replacing the engine is that the shop will just put a used engine in the car. Not a rebuilt one. Just a used one. Which will most likely have the same problem this one has. This is the second time I've owned a Toyota and the second time I've gotten a dodgy engine. This will be the last time I have to deal with Toyota and their engines, because I will not buy another. I'll get a Honda CRV or Nissan Rouge. No more Toyotas.\",\n",

This is my sixth Nissan/Infiniti up till now every vehicle has been bullet proof.  Have to say every single issue being reported about this vehicle seems to be absolutely true.  Transmission abrupt shifting, diesel odor in cabin, clunking noise in front end, power cut off when turning, and electronic issues!!  Transmission shifting hard up and down.  On the way home from the dealership in TN headed to OH the vehicle was barely drivable.  It shifted so hard down that I was seriously concerned it would damage itself so I had to drive it at constant speed making trip intense to say the least.  Note this was after the TN dealership supposedly completed the \"transmission update\".  I limped vehicle into dealership in Dayton OH.  Dayton Nissan dealer completed transmission update and advised vehicle good to go.  Picked up vehicle and drove it off lot...first lot clunk!  All day long...downshift clunk!...upshift pop!.  Oh man now I\\'m really getting concerned.  I\\'m so concerned about transmission damaging itself that I\\'m overlooking the other problems.  But lets talk about those.  My next main concern is the loss of power when turning.  You turn and hit the gas to accelerate and there is nothing there!!  I\\'m not talking turbo lag I\\'m talking literally the power goes to zero!  Then equally bad when after it goes to zero it lags big time then abruptly comes on.  I\\'ve been trying different driving habits to see if it does this in straight aways or if it is strictly on turns.  It is most definitely more pronounced when turning.  Talk about dangerous!!  Just today pulled out at major intersection and gas truck coming towards light in first lane...pull out quarter way when I realize man this guy can\\'t stop.  Turning left.  Hit gas to get away as smoke is billowing out from under his truck and nothing!!  Thank Jesus as the truck was going to smack me broadside power kicked on and I escaped major incident if not death.  Wow!!  Had I been driving my BMW X5 diesel under same circumstances it would have jetted me away so quick I wouldn\\'t have even thought about it later in the day.  This thing is a potential death trap!  Ok so enough drama.  The odor enters the cabin while idling, driving slow, and occasional a waft or two while tooling down the highway.  My friend the other day while idling was like \"dude seriously this thing is making me nauseous\".  I\\'m like well you get used to it after awhile.  He was like hurry up and get me to our destination I don\\'t know how you are driving this like this.  Electronics are full of gremlins on this baby.  Get in fire her up and on comes the screen stating tran data is being transmitted...shift into R and camera should kick on ...would be nice...but instead screen doesn\\'t change!  Good thing I didn\\'t back up because a kid was standing behind my truck and well...hmm...accident!!  Are you kidding me?!!  What good is a back up camera on a vehicle if it isn\\'t reliable?!  It is more unsafe might as well disconnect it!!!  Ok so lets talk about more issues that are nuisance but not going to cause bodily injury or death.

Not the issueDealership did a compression test, said it needs a new engine. $18,000! BMW will cover 50% because it's out of warranty. I provided all oil change docs. BMW wanted to see oil changes at least every 15k. I averaged every 7,500 miles. Never auto crossed or tracked. Commuter car, 42 year old father of four. Not laying down patches or beating on the car.My take, don't buy a turbo model. Too much stress on the engine components. Never own one of these out of warranty, you're asking for trouble. Fuel pump was replaced under warranty (common issue), water pump was on  my dime. Hardly reliable, worst car I've ever owned. Beast on the highway? at 4.3 0-60 yes. Sad to say it, I'm a Bimmer guy through and through but that's it for me. BMW corporate said they wouldn't make a repair coverage decision until they knew for sure what the problem was. I wanted the dealership to drop the oil pan to definitively diagnose the issue  so I could tell BMW NA what was wrong. After the compression test all of a sudden the dealership clammed up like it was a cover up? The dealership would not go any further. They told the manufacturer that it needed a new engine without ever dropping the oil pan and taking a peek. Didn't make sense. I still want to have an independent garage take a look so maybe I can get some video or pics and post them. Forget about BMW customer service. I got someone on the line outsourced from India.

              " ' The BMW X6 i50 was the worst car I have ever had.  If you’re thinking about buying one you better buy a fire extinguisher and a few cases of oil.  I bought a Vermelain Red Black interior 2012.  Loved the car at the time.  Paid big bucks, everything at BMW is a “package”.  I like to keep my cars – not this one.  I had it about a month and it had a chassis malfunction. No one could figure out what that was and the problem came and went.  Then there was an indicator for “increased battery discharge”.  The dealer changed cables etc., I brought it in about 4 times then demanded a new battery which I got.  Then the indicator said “high battery drain”.  Fed up at this point I waited until the car had to go in for the next service.  When I brought it in they wouldn’t release the car back.  The keyless system was somehow communicating with the battery and the car was ready to go on fire.  Around the same time about 5,000 miles the car is asking for oil.  They said that’s all normal wait until it hits 15,000 miles.  15,000 miles came and went the car needed a quart of oil every 5000 miles.  The need for oil then started to increase as the mileage continued to increase.  Eventually, every 900 miles the car needed oil.  BMW insisted that was all normal.  I wrote to Germany (in German) they referred the problem to BMW North America.  They sent a service technician to look at the vehicle – said it was all normal.  I was the one topping off the oil not BMW.  Then they told me they wanted me to go to the dealer every time it needed oil.  Really! – I drive over a 100 miles a day.  The dealer is about 2 hours away round trip.  I would waste 2 hours every 2 weeks on oil!  Beyond that, BMW did nothing.  At approximately 50,000 miles it didn’t seem to have the drive or acceleration intensity that is used to have; it couldn’t get out of it’s own way.  The dealer said it was normal.  The next visit for service not long after the complaint of lack of acceleration – eureka it’s leaking oil and the turbos need rebuilding (which was another 6 weeks at the dealer).  That was fixed I drive into my driveway to see the “oil” light go on again – back to the dealer I go.  After all that the car did regain its acceleration that it should have.  Now 5 years later I am still putting a quart of oil in the car every 900 miles.  It needs brakes (normal maintenance), turbos either need to be rebuilt or replaced, and the I Drive is playing games.  You put it on one thing and it changes itself to another.  Using an independent mechanic certified in BMW who doesn’t charge like a dealer the cost of this vehicle to keep for 1 year has been $10,000.  After paying $90,000 for a vehicle you would expect a lot more from the car, the dealer and BMW – you get nothing from any of them.

              " ' The control arm on my 2013 Nissan Altima (3.5L SL) broke while entering the freeway on (7/20) during rush hour, causing me to lose steering in the rear of my vehicle. The equipment failure caused me to be stranded on the highway, forcing me to have my car towed to the nearest auto repair shop, costing me $2,220 in repairs. My vehicle only had 72,720 miles when the malfunction occurred. In reaching out to I-90 Nissan in Sheffield Ohio, which is where I purchased my vehicle, the staff was friendly but deferred me to Nissan Corporate to file a claim with Consumer Affairs. Consumer Affairs denied my claim because I did not take my vehicle to an “authorized dealer”. While stranded on the highway, the last place I was thinking about taking me vehicle was to the dealer (15+ miles away) that sold me a car that had a major equipment failure in less than 5 years of owning it. The broken control arm was completely rusted out, with an unsealed hole at the top, allowing water and salt to pour in. The other control arm was rusted, with stress fractures and was on its way to break soon. Lesley at Nissan Corporate told me she stands by the quality of Nissan vehicles. If control arms rusting out, breaking and causing people to lose control of their vehicle is considered quality, then I ENCOURAGE ANYONE LOOKING TO PURCHASE A NISSAN TO USE CAUTION!Also, the hood of my trunk has rust issues, which was “fixed” years ago. The same rusted out areas are back. I also have \"rail dust\" all over my vehicle. It seems Nissan has an issue with their vehicles and parts rusting out early.',\n",
              " ' 750 miles on a new 2018 LE Corolla.  It\\'s OK as a grocery getter for your mother-in-law.  However, acceleration and highway driving in any hills or mountains is a loser.   A lot of engine noise with any acceleration.  RPM = Noise in this car.  Very slow getting going from a stop, for the first 100 feet, then the engine spools up, making a lot of noise, but not a lot of acceleration.  Driving at 60 with cruise control on, the car will go faster down hill to about 65, then the CVT \"downshifts\" the car and the engine revs to 4,500 rpm to slow it down; however it really doesn\\'t do much but make a lot of noise.  The driver gives over control of the car to the lousy transmission.  There is only D, S and B.  The owner\\'s manual said nothing about these positions.  Moving to S, is adds RPM and some slowing.  moving to B makes a lot more RPM and more slowing.  There is no way to have any other control over this transmission than just those positions.   With a real 6 speed manual or automatic transmission, this would be a much better economy car.  I\\'ve owned five cars with less HP and better acceleration due to 5 speed manual transmissions that did not slip and slide like the CT.  The CVT makes it a DUD.  One additional thing that I found to be troubling was rear window visibility.  With fixed headrests on both sides of the vehicle, and an adjustable one in the center, it restricted visibility when making a quick lane change.  The headrests are only needed with rear passengers.  I ended up lowering the back rest on the passenger side to remove the visual obstruction of the right and center headrests, meaning we drove around with the trunk open to the interior.  A poor design done to save money.',\n",

After letting the dealership look at the truck the only answer I got was it\\'s a \"Toyota Problem\". I called and got Toyota involved and got a case brought on the truck. At 1000 miles I was still complaining about the performance with no help from the dealer or Toyota. I kept taking it back and at 15,000 miles I had had enough of the run around and wanted to just get rid of it and try again. The dealer offered me $4000.00 less than what I owed. This is after the Service manager had told me that I was not the only one complaining about the truck. I\\'ve been driving the truck and now at 55k my son can run faster than the truck. I wanted to stay with a Tacoma because I\\'ve still got a 2004 double cab 6 cyl that has been one the best trucks I\\'ve ever owned.

In less than three years (still under warranty as I write this), I\\'ve had no less than 4 different rattles and tapping noises to chase down. This started before 1K miles!

I\\'d been to the dealer a total of three times to fix the other noises and a \"catch\" in the moonroof cover to no avail.

Initially, BMW changed out these components, one at a time and each time you had a check engine light come on the would replace the next most commonly malfunctioning part. Eventually, they started flat out replacing all the components since they would eventually fail (I believe due to the heat and pressure they are placed under with the twin turbo.

He said he spend over 10k on transmission work and eventual replacement while he owned the vehicle for only 6 months, 2 of those months was spent in the shop. These repair costs were not covered by BMW.   Some sleazy owners, will not mention this program/issue at all to you when selling the car (which was what happened in my case). Luckily the deal fell through in the 11th hour at the bank when the vehicle failed state inspection (due to worn out tires and brakes in this case). Owner claimed that both tires and brakes were replaced within the last 6 months. Some owners and used car salesmen are doing whatever they can to u load these problematic vehicles.

We own the car for 5 years and 2 months, it has 61,000 miles on, mostly highway miles between Illinois and New Jersey; the car is like new, it was garaged when we lived in Illinois for 4 years.  The engine on car failed, it was confirmed by dealer that new engine is required.  Toyotas reputation was good, so we never thought or bothered to look into any extended warranty, this is the main reason why we drive them for over 20 years.  Since we are loyal Toyota customers, and warranty just expired, we turned to Toyota corporate to see if the repair can be covered by warranty; but they giving us a cold shoulder, making excuses, impersonating other people in corporate, it's not pretty.  This car also had a serious issue with a back seat belt, when my wife had to call 911 while in shopping mall, when my daughter got strangled and could not release it, it was just getting tighter and tighter: 911 had to cut the seat belt with a knife.\",\n",

And, before I bought it, I insisted the seller take it to a BMW dealership and have it checked out. It cost me $100, and was found to have no issues at that time. Within the first six months, all the seals for the transfer case had to be replaced - $3,300. Within the next year, it started blowing white smoke from the exhaust, also common with this model. I took it in for an oil change and diagnosis for the white smoke. The repair shop found 3 small pieces from the oil pan and informed me that I needed a new oil pump, another common issue with the 4.4 engine - $3,000. Next, they informed me that, due to BMW using cheap valve guides which wore out prematurely causing the engine to burn oil, those had to be replaced. Another common issue with the 4.4 engine.  Cost - $7,000. My extended warranty provider refused to pay for repairs that totaled more than the value of the vehicle, so I ended up paying $4,000 out of pocket. After only six months since the rebuild, the engine is now leaking oil all over the driveway. Total cost paid by me and extended warranty = $22,000.

Cost to repair - estimated at $6000 to  $7000 or so, before repairs were made.  I was not happy. After several conversions and an expression to the dealership about my lost faith in Toyota - I had hoped to own this car to over 200,000 miles or more - they eventually involved the factory.  In all fairness, the factory ended up picking up all but about $1500 or so, which I paid.

But it turns out this car is defective and made with a bad transmission. Because of this major defect, we have reason to believe there’s extremely poor quality control of the production process of this entire car if not other 2017 Camry’s. We weren’t given a chance to test drive the new car by our dealer. On our way back home on 11/18, we noticed that the car jerked forward abnormally every time when we pressed on the brake.  We took our car back to the dealer on 11/22 after try driving it multiple times at dealer’s recommendation. It took the dealer 4 hours to fix it. They adjusted the fluid level within the transmission according to the paperwork.  We haven’t had a chance driving the car again until 12/5 because of a flu in the family. On 12/5, the car won’t reverse and showed a warning message “Check Vehicle Stability Control System”. On 12/6/16, Toyota sent a toll truck and took our car back to the dealer’s service department. This time the service department replaced the defective new transmission with a re-manufactured (non-new) transmission.  In two weeks after we had this car, the car has gone through 2 repairs on transmission and included the replacement of transmission on a brand new car. We paid for a brand new Toyota Camry XLE, now 2 weeks later, the transmission is broken and replaced with a refurbished transmission. It might be a better choice to just buy a used car with much less price. This is a terrible new car experience for us and we have to warn other consumers about it. There should be something special about owning a new car. Toyota destroyed our experience by giving us a defective car and wants us to go through a lengthy process to get a refund or replacement. Stay away from 2017 Toyota Camry!!',\n",

The navigation screen is slanted so that for many hours in the morning, afternoon, and evening, it reflects sunlight directly into the driver's eyes blinding them.  The center console arm rest moves forward when you brake and moves backward when you accelerate - I took it back to the dealer and they said it is working correctly - but I have never seen one move as freely as this one and I have probably driven over 100 autos with moveable console armrests.  Also the armrest was leaking white grease down into the storage are below it and the dealer did nothing about it.  I believe it was built with one or more of the stops that are supposed to be in the armrest to keep it from moving freely were left out during manufacture but the dealer - Fort Worth Toyota took no action to try to discover why it moves so freely.  Also the speedometer reads about 4  mph high and when I took it back to Fort Worth Toyota, they overlaid a photo of a GPS speed over a laptop computer video of the speedometer and said it was accurate at 70 mph, but that is a bold faced lie.  I have since talked to a number of other owners of RAV4s and they also have the inaccurate speedometers going all the way back to the 2008 RAV4.  If the speedometer is reading high, it is probably also recording mileage driven as 4 miles high which probably helps them advertise that their vehicles get better gas mileage than the really do.  The US justice department should look into this as this is another example of what Volkswagen did with their diesel engines.  The width of the windshield supports on each side of the car and the way they are angled create very large blind spots making it hard to see coming vehicles when you are turning either right or left.  The clock is angled up and is partially shielded from view by the navigation screen and is really small so it can't be seen most of the time.  Also the display in the instrument panel where they show the temperature is extremely small and almost unusuable.

Oscar told me they were fixing it.

What a service. What a disappointment. What a dishonesty. What a bunch of thieves. I lost sleep over it and I am sure they will deny it so what's the point of dealing with dishonest service shop.

All the electrical power stays intact. The RPMs stay around 1 no matter how far down I push the gas pedal. The most serious incident occurred a day ago. I pulled out from a stop sign. As I turned right I accelerated to 10 mph then nothing. No response to me pushing the gas pedal.  I floored it, nothing. I eased into it, nothing. It slowed to 5 mph and crept until I could pull off on a side street.  I put it in park and back in drive and it seemed to do the trick.

They claim that due to recent heavy rains and driving through \"a puddle\" 5 weeks earlier caused a piston connecting rod to break through the side of the engine block! This is even though the car ran perfectly for the entire 5 week period and 2500 miles after the rain event without even the slightest vibration. What they couldn\\'t explain, at all, was how enough water made it past the air cleaner without getting the air cleaner wet or damaged! The rain event did short a couple electronic systems as error codes indicated and put the car into a \"limp-home\" mode, but were simply cleared and reset after I had them checked. Interestingly, the service advisor and a service manager kept aggressively encouraging me to \"just file a claim with your insurance carrier\" and that \"people have been doing it there all the time\"! It seemed like a \"go-to\" line for these guys even though any competent mechanic would conclude that this engine did not \"blow\" due to water damage! I checked with a few!

              " \" We enjoyed our Quest for the first five years. The van had a smooth ride. I liked the interior layout with the folding seats and no need to remove large middle-row seats. We could haul large objects without having to remove clunky middle row seats, and we thought we were getting a better quality van than a Chrysler product. With the back two rows of seats folded flat, we had a bedding area for long trips to Florida. The hidden trunk in the back provided nice storage. We were making some nice memories with our van. In the first year or two we started to worry a little when our van would stall on downhill angles with 1/4 tank of gas or less. A technical service bulletin software update fixed that problem with no cost.  Routine maintenance generally kept our van rolling along. Second set of tires at just over 40,000miles and that set lasted nearly 60,000 miles. Brakes replaced at about 88,000 miles. Only unexpected repair had been a rear A/C line at 80,000 miles. Well, things began going bad in the last few months. The van began lurching or having RPM surges while driving at speed--especially with cruise set while going up a small grade or hill. Was that the transmission slipping? The problem happened rarely enough that our local Nissan dealer could not replicate it during a test drive. Then after the 105,000 mile service the transmission problems worsened. On a long trip we had lots of cruising on the freeway. The tachometer would bounce while maintaining speed. If we encountered a hill the RPMs might bounce from 2000 up to 2400 with no gain in speed. The bounce lasted a second or two and it occurred on minor inclines. Local driving too and from work seemed fine, but then a short trip to family was the last straw. A couple times on this trip shifting from reverse to drive produced a clunking sound with marginal acceleration. (That can't be good.) We had two or three episodes in which the van took a long time to move from a stop on an uphill grade. (That experience seemed marginally dangerous.) Then the check engine light confirmed our fears. We nursed it back to our dealer. The tranny was dead. We are now two weeks into waiting for a replacement. Five years with the van was fine, but then we learned the error of our ways in purchasing the Nissan Quest with the CVT. Our dealer is still waiting for a replacement transmission while we kick ourselves for not purchasing the Honda, Toyota, or even the Chrysler. While it may not help our efforts to unload this thing in a year or so, buyers should beware of Nissan CVTs...especially in the Quest. A quick contact with corporate produced the expected apology for inconvenience with no real help.  Five years old and just over 100,000 miles and the transmission pukes? Please learn from our experience.Update in 2018: So we had the dealer replace the transmission at 107,800 miles and hoped for the best. After another 5,000 miles or so, my wife began to worry about being stranded if the new transmission puked. I thought that we could just drive it into the ground. After laying out over $3,000 for a replacement transmission, I was not eager to get rid of the vehicle. My opinion began to change when I noticed hesitation shifting from reverse to drive. Initially I thought it was just paranoia because of the first transmission failing. The issue happened a few times, with a hesitation and a lurch. Okay, I am not the guy to leave my wife driving a marginally reliable vehicle (or maybe it gave me an excuse to shop for a replacement). We decided to replace the van, and we sold it with a little over 116,000 miles on it...about 5 months after replacing the transmission.

              " ' I\\'ve owned this car for a little over two years. Prior to that, I had a 4-speed 2001 Corolla CE that I owned for 5 years. Pros:- The engine is a typical Toyota engine, which means it hasn\\'t changed much over the years. While it might lack some of the power compared to its competitors, I\\'d be pretty confident with it lasting a long time.- The CVT isn\\'t too bad in this vehicle. Toyota put in artifical shift points so it feels more like a conventional transmission. Reliability seems to be pretty good as I haven\\'t seen any failures posted online.- The interior is pretty nice. The S model has some nice stitching that makes it feel upscale.- The back seats are pretty roomy and comfortable. Granted, this generation is larger than the past ones, but it\\'s good if you need to shuttle people.- MPGs are pretty good. I get 35 average with mixed city/highway driving. This drops to 32 in the winter. But I\\'m in general pretty light on the throttle.Cons:- The headlights are awful. I don\\'t understand how so many people rated them as good. There\\'s a \"lid\" on the LED headlights to prevent it shining out too much. What this does is creates a sharp cut-off for low-beams. To make things worse, because the lights are bright white, it means you can\\'t see anything beyond the cut-off point. It also is very blinding to other drivers. I can\\'t stand it when another Corolla comes up behind me. I honestly try to avoid driving at night with this car, but that becomes impossible to do in winter. I never had this issue with my old car.- Handling is poor and requires a lot of manual correction. The steering doesn\\'t transmit a lot of feedback to the driver.- The CVT loves to rev up everytime you apply the gas even in small amounts. This causes the engine RPMs to jostle around a lot. Even with the artifical shift points, it\\'s still a CVT at the end of the day and rather dull. Engine braking with it is barely there as it\\'s designed for fuel economy.- The Entune system doesn\\'t allow mp3 files and folders to be read like a directory on a computer. It insists on reading all the tags and sorting them that way. If you want to play files on a USB stick or CD, make sure they are all tagged correctly first.- The dashboard and interior lights are all bright blue or white and are constantly illuminated. I\\'d much prefer a softer color for night driving.- The automatic headlights were removed in this generation. Between this and the previous issue, I\\'ve seen other Corolla drivers with headlights off at dusk. That\\'s not a good thing at all.If it wasn\\'t for the headlight issue, this would be another Corolla that I would keep for many years. But because of the headlight issue, I\\'m probably going to trade it in for something else.',\n",

The early pics of the new Titan were concerning;  it looked like a mash-up of various other brands, and just way overdone, e.g. the ridiculous emblems on the front fenders. Still, I wanted to see the truck in person and drive the beast. When it finally arrived at a close-enough dealer, I made the trip. Talk about a let-down! This thing is an abomination. Just WAY too big for a \\'tweener. Maybe it should be marketed to WWE performers, because it\\'s so massive in every respect. Except performance. Sluggish acceleration, and despite having a price tag at or above \"real\" heavy duty trucks, it does not provide real heavy duty truck capabilities. The SV I looked at and drove had an MSRP of $55k, and the dealer wasn\\'t going to \"move much\" off that price.

In summary, I could buy this new Titan (and I was truly a Nissan advocate, having owned five of their vehicles in the last 15 years) with less capability and unproven reliability but pay more for it, vs. a proven star heavy duty truck in the RAM mentioned.

I made a big mistake to buy the 2015 Camry SE instead  of researching more on a Honda Accord or Nissan Altima.  The Camry was way under power and it made so much road noise on highway as though you were driving a 10 year old car.  Braking system is pretty bad that you have to press hard on brake for a stop.  The seats are rough and pain in the butt after an hour drive (not comfort at all).  The only good thing on this car is having more space and leg room and a back up camera as a standard compare to the previous model. So as you read this, do try to give yourself a good test drive on highway if you really want a Camry.  My guess you better off with the LE model since the struts are not stiff and you have a normal tires.  Anyway, regardless of what model of Camry you buy (4 or 6 cylinders) they are all under power and it will make you very frustrated for the money you paid.  I later try a test drive on a Nissan Altima and the Honda Accord and what I would say both the Nissan and the Accord are excellent  drive and comfort.  If in the scale 1-10 of rating I would rate the Camry 5 and the Altima/Accord would be 9. One more thing to note, The Nissan Altima is the best for the comfort, space, and gas mileage.',\n",

I've used two phones that are Qi charger capable and both sometimes work in the car and sometimes don't.  They both charge perfectly on the wireless charger at home.   In summary the car drives well, but the AC and the electronics problems make the car a poor choice if you're a driver who wants his $90,000 car to work as advertised.  If you're wondering why I gave it two stars rather than one, it's because the AC problem doesn't matter in the winter.\",\n",

              " ' I was told that the Rav 4 was just as safe comparable to the subuaru and the Rogue.  They were wrong.  A shopping cart with a heavy bag of dog food got away from the customer and headed across the parking lot and I didn’t see it and backed into it damaging a small section of the back bumper.  The car didn’t indicate that there was something headed for the back of the vehicle and it didnt indicate there was a collision.  I was so upset I thought I hit someone with the car!  I was relieved that it was a shopping cart and not a pedestrian.  Every time I look at the bumper I see the damage that could have been a child on a bike that could have died due to the poor/deceptive safety specs of the vehicle.  I think god everyday that it was just a shopping cart.  I no longer trust the safety specs and rely on the mirrors.  I don’t even trust the rear camera or the blind spot indicators.  It’s a cute sporty SUV and it’s very comfortable and can handle well in snow and on curves.  It has poor acceleration performance especially driving up a hill and accelerating onto highways.  There is no brake assist at all not even a little bit.  I also almost hit a tree head on during one of the nor’easters due to the poor visibility.  I diverted hitting the tree that was laying across the road the last second.  That’s when I realized the from indicators aren’t reliable either.  So if you are looking for a sporty vehicle without the safety specs this is the perfect buy.  If you are looking for a safe family SUV with all the safety specs you need to steer away from this and run.  The Rogue and subuaru are the safer bet.',\n",

Our battery has gone dead for no reason THREE times. Just recently the A/C quit, and the ride feels much more bouncy than normal. Top this all off with a poor average of 17mpg mostly highway fuel economy- Terrible!!I hope I can get a good trade in value for this lemon!',\n",
              " ' The check engine light has been (and still is) on since I think day 2 of ownership. Took it to Toyota several times, the last one they stated the code is generic and represents over 500 possible problems it could be. It took 3 months just to get it to pass PA inspection, brakes/rotors replaced too many times within 70k miles of driving, the stainless steel tube at the power steering resevoir blew out, the seats are the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in, the interior is chincy looking for $26k, the engine is sluggish and noisy, weird wind noise w/ 4 windows down. This is the 2nd and probably last Toyota for us.',\n",

I have never DESPISED a vehicle so much in my life and totally wish I could take the damn thing back.A. GAS MILEAGE - gets 13-14 MPG, doesnt matter if you take the interstate or backroads. The thing is a gas hog and JEEPS and other full-sized trucks get better MPG. Absolute total JUNKB. The so-called new Electric Transmission B.S. -   Absolute JUNK - it shifts weird, it is slow (okay I guess, if you are an old man or old woman that loves to cruse at about 30 mph. HORRIBLE - and I absolutely despise it.C. Software onboard - absolutely TERRIBLE. THe GPS lags, it is NOT user friendly and they don't use Android or Apple iOS friendly software so, you have to get used to their CRAPPY TOYOTA SOFTWARE. Bloat/Junkware is what it is.D. Drive - the Drive - Feels like a LINCOLN or a Cadillac. Might be okay if again: you are an 80 year old man or woman that loves the feel of a slow, squooshy cadillac that feels top heavy and bouncy. Absolutely a TERRIBLE drive and feel to it.E. Handling - The steering wheel feels like that of a big TRACTOR. Reminds me of when I was back on the farm, in IOWA... Loose steering, you can't take your eyes of the road for a split second or you are swearving into the other lane or onto a curb...F. Oh, and only one door handle unlocks the truck... Keyless entry will only unlock the POS if you are on the drivers' side... and there is NO KEYLESS Start... It is a Limited, with no extra features, but sold as if it is Fully Loaded... Totally not - it's over priced JUNK...MY VOTE FOR THE WORST VEHICLE:   the Toyota Tacoma... I hate this darn truck more than any vehicle I have ever driven in all 36 years of my life... JUNK!\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \" I went to trade in my 2001 Ford Explorer for a more fuel efficient vehicle. The dealership showed me was the 2012 Nissan Versa SV Sedan with the CVT transmission. I loved the look of the car, the price was alright, mileage was great, and as I test drove it around the block it seemed to drive wonderfully. The day after I purchased the Versa, I noticed when driving it was acting funny. As I was accelerating, it acted like it didn't want to go. It lagged terribly and made this odd noise under the hood. I immediately took it to the dealership and asked them to please drive it because it seemed something was wrong. They told me that it was because I was not custom to driving with a CVT transmisson and sent me on. The same thing continued and I kept telling myself I needed to just get used to driving it. A couple months go by and I begin to notice when I am parked or sitting at a light, the entire car will vibrate all over along with this rattle noise. I took it to the dealership and told them about the issues during my service appointment and they gave me the same run around. So I let it go to see if maybe I was still freaking out for no reason. A few more months go by and the acceleration was getting worse and worse. It got to where it took about 3 to 5 seconds for the car to accelerate from a stop, the vibration when idle became worse and louder, and a loud hum noise began to come from the car. I had my service due in a few weeks so I was going to mention it all again then but my visits became early. As I was accelerating from a two-way stop (I was at the stop sign). I saw to my right that nothing was coming and to my left, there was an 18 wheeler coming. I had more than enough time to go on and go. As I did, my car stalled as usual and shut off completely in the middle of the intersection causing the 18 wheeler to drive into the ditch!!! No one was hurt thankfully but it was dangerous! I immediately the nex day went straight to the dealership and told them something had t be done! I wanted a trade in and they wouldn't do this. They suggested fixing the transmission (finally). I was given a rental car for the three weeks it took them to replace my transmission with a new one (@ 74,000 miles). This past Thursday afternoon (3/23/17) I was told my car was ready to be picked up. I went up there to pick it up and immediately as I drive out of the dealership, I notice that the vibration is still there, the humming noise, the brakes acted like they didn't want to work (jerking motion), and the acceleration is better but not perfect. I called my mother and told her that the car is still doing the same things and that I am going back up there tomorrow (Friday... 3/24/17). My mother and I went up there the next morning very angry and upset telling them the same things were still happening and everyone seemed to be getting pissed with us. We were told that the transmission had been fixed and nothing is wrong with my car. I was told that it was in my head and I was worrying for no reason. I overheard a salesman say that we were just looking to trade because I wanted a new car. I had a technician drive the car with me because they suggested him to do so. However, no one would listen to me and drive the car longer than 2 mins around the block. You had to drive it about ten minutes to start to hear the humming sound and feel the vibrations. I became very upset and left because we were just getting the run around AGAIN! Well, as I am driving the rest of the day, the hum noise becomes worse and worse! At about 11:30 pm that Friday night, I am driving home from clinicals and not even a mile from my house, I begin to hear an awful clanking noise coming from under the car and I could feel it in the floorboard. I thought it would be okay til I get home because I was so close. I had one stop sign to stop at before getting to my house. As I accelerate from the stop sign, the hum and clank noise become louder and louder and I notice my car is veering the right. No matter how much I turn my steering wheel to the left, it will not go to the left. I immediately try to brake and the car acts like it does not want to brake. It jerks and is still going to the right. I get down to about 20 miles per hour and I am going off onto the side of the road and finally, I stop by hitting a speed limit sign! I called my mother freaking out asking her to come down the road. We called the sheriff department and wrecker service to come out there. I didn't turn the car off when I got out just because I didn't think about it. As my mother and I are standing out there waiting for them to arrive, we start to hear this loud fan type noise coming from under the hood and see a slight glimpse of smoke. We immediately turned the car off! Now, my car is at the body shop and we are going to the dealership first thing when they open on Monday! PLEASE DO NOT BUY A VERSA!!!!!! I am not the only person I know who has had this type of issue go on with their Versa.\",\n",

Platinum series, fully loaded, only 25k miles, but $35,000 worth of heartache. Roughly 120 miles into our trip, the car began shuttering at low speeds. When we stopped to refuel 400 miles into our trip, the transmission wouldn\\'t engage when my husband put the car in \"Drive.\" After repeated attempts he finally got the transmission to engage and we were able to \"limp it\" to the nearest Auto Nation dealer and sit and wait 4 hours for them to open. However, because it is Sunday, the service department is closed. The Atlanta location offered to reimburse me for either a modest (not comparable) rental or a hotel while we wait for an indefinite period of time for our vehicle to be looked at and a determination to be made from there - a kind gesture but hardly the consideration I\\'d expect given the circumstances and the capabilities of a multimillion dollar netting corporation. After an unexpected 9 hour delay in Memphis (with an 11, 6, 5 year old and 2 month old) we are now back on the road in a rental vehicle that I had to incur the upfront out of pocket cost for (with no idea of when/if a reimbursement will actually occur in addition to the $4k I have the dealership for a down payment). I will also have to modify my trip to be by my father\\'s side in order to coordinate the issue of driving back to Memphis to retrieve my vehicle (which I no longer want) and return the rental vehicle during the company\\'s business hours. All of this is a nightmare in addition to the nightmare that I am already dealing with. As a consumer (and previous Nissan owner) I just expected better. Polite but unhelpful (especially when Nissan is already clearly aware of the issue after reading endless consumer reviews which highlight a week established history of an issue requiring a recall or buyer warning) is not only immoral, but also shameful. My excitement of purchasing my Roadster this summer after so many years of pining for it has now gone out the window. I\\'ll never buy another Nissan and I will caution anyone who will listen to me to avoid doing the same for as long as I have breath and the faculties to communicate. I\\'m both devastated and disheartened and at less than 24 hours into my purchase, the issue is likely only beginning...',\n",

Within the first year i had issues with the fog lamps loosening therefore not functioning, the infotainment system rebooting while in use, drivers seat would slide back and forward at take off and when braking, a recall on the hood latch and a recall on the airbag sensors causing the car to think no one was in the passenger seat and turning off the passenger side airbags. Second year, A/C compressor was replaced and transmission completely failed on me and was replaced (under warranty, thank god). I\\'m approaching the end of the second year and the transmission may need replacing again. Electrical system is complete crud. And headlights flicker when i drive over the slightest bump. All lamps are loose. I especially regret paying an additional $1000 for the infotainment system because it often doesn\\'t recognize that my phone is connected so i cant play my music or speak on the phone over the speakers. Rear view camera is great when im backing into parking spaces but it tends to glitch like a television using an antenna in the middle of a hurricane. Also, compared to the rear view camera in a 2009 Maxima, the picture quality is bad and almost useless after sundown. The \\'09 Maxima was very clear and vibrant in color both night and day. The rear view camera is used to determine whether there is someone in your blind spot and i can honestly say that it was wrong 40% of the time. It is also used to determine whether you\\'re too close to the center lines so that it can alert you. This feature is called \"Lane Departure Warning\" and often didn\\'t work either. A minor complaint would be that any time i have a passenger get out of the car, they have a hard time shutting the door on the first try. You practically have to slam them shut. The horn is weak, sucks if you\\'re a honker like me haha. Navigation system always had a false ETA. For example, last night my ETA was 12:26 but the time was 12:53. Plus the navigation update is over $200+ just fyi. So if you live in a constantly developing area, like myself, the Navigation isn\\'t going to recognize any of the new streets. Not going to drop $200+ every time a new business is put up. I\\'m actually currently looking to buy a 10 year old Acura. Update: I\\'ve now owned a 2006 Audi A6 Avant for 6 months and have had no issues like the ones listed above. Doesn\\'t say much, as they\\'re two totally different cars built almost a decade apart. But it does say a lot as far as preference goes. I\\'m enjoying my 11 year old station wagon more than I enjoyed my once brand new Nissan Altima.',\n",

Can't see the hood because the dashboard sits so high so can't judge where the front of the vehicle is. Front bumper sits too low. Road noise is deafening. With the crappy low profile tires that came on it the ride is very uncomfortable and you feel every bump!  Navigation system has no way to just shut it off and no way for a passenger to program it while vehicle is in motion. Not user friendly at all. Sound system is inferior to my Bose system in my Acura. Seats were very uncomfortable on a long road trip and lack of lumbar support in passenger seat was disturbing. Only good thing is leg room in the back and the trunk is spacious but lacks a cargo net which I love in my Acura. With 175,000 miles my Acura rides better, is quieter and has better gas mileage than this Avalon. And to think the Avalon was my dream car turned nightmare!!!\",\n",

The only good thing about it is the LED headlights are super.  From there it only goes downhill.  There is excessive road noise, so much so that with the radio on you can\\'t hear the warning beeps for the blind spot or lane departure.  The Intelligent Lane Intervention, an oxymoron, is a joke and functions so poorly that it is actually unsafe.  It misses the lane departure without a warning on occasion and wanders so far over the lane as to be unsafe, before it reacts. Nissan USA and Local dealership were notified of this defect in writing and never got a response from either.  So much for Customer Support!  The Econ button is located below the dash and has to be activated every time when starting the car. Doesn\\'t stay on.  The \"premium\" radio is terrible.  Very poor muddy sound.  The ride is very rough and stiff and is noisy regardless of road condition.  This is the top of the line for this model and it misses the mark badly, though it does have a nice sporty look that is very deceiving!

I bought a replacement and installed it and even drilled the underside to mount two bolts and nut to secure it. But when hurricane Harvey came it was washed away again with my plate number with it. How in the world would you consider this a an offroad vehicle if a foot deep of water will rip the front bumper valance out. I emailed Toyota customer care and was told to call but when I did, I was informed that I was the only one who was complaining about it. So I went to sterling McCall Toyota dealer and again was told that I should only drive my vehicle on roads with less water, for 4x4 is only good for traction but not for a foot deep of water. Frankly , I'm very disappointed!!\",\n",

I couldn't believe they gave me that excuse, so I took it to the dealer again and after complaining they finally looked at it and they fixed the part that was defected. Now March 2016 my car started to accelerate or jump on its own while I was driving. The problem grew worse when making a left turn the car barely moved even though I pressed on the gas all the way the car seem like it wouldn't budge. There were also times I would press in the gas and the car started to feel like it would jump and feel like it was about to shut off. I thought the fuel filter needed to be fixed, once we took it to the dealer the problem was that the car needed a new transmission. Fortunately, the car was under warranty so they are supposed to be fixing it. Another feature I noticed that doesn't work properly is that sometimes when the front passenger is sitting it reads as if nobody is sitting there, so if I were an accident the bag could possible not deploy.

This has been my 33rd car that I've owned through life, yes, I've had a lot of cars, but I have a habit of buying, modding, trading, or selling cars until I bought the 2010 Altima. It was strictly for work and the ensure that I don't have the mod bug to try and modify this car.  It worked for a couple years and I started to look at upgrading the seats, stereo, rims, etc.; however, at 75k miles, I replaced the struts and lower control arms.  Then, the transmission began to whine a lot which is a recall from Nissan which got extended to 120k miles.  With that said, the dealership must deal with Nissan and perform all that corporate request on the car before swapping out the transmission with a new one.  That puts a strain on the customer who must take time off of work and drop off the car three times before the CVT transmission was finally replaced at 107k miles.  Now, the techs found out that the struts are leaking once again, and the lower control arms are shot.   I've replaced them with factory Nissan parts and drive mainly highway to and from work, I avoid bad roadways and mainly use the cruise control once on the highway, so I don't drive it crazy.  I've replaced the oil cooler gasket which cost close to $500.00 and was about to replace the alternator for the second time along with a belt but at this point, the cost of repairing everything wrong with the car cost more than what I owed on it and I got rid of it.  I bought this car as a step towards buying a 370Z since I've owned a G35 in the past and never had issues. I've had bad experiences from 6 Nissan dealerships from owning this car for 4 years: 3 in Houston and 3 in the DFW area.  Now, the last Nissan dealership took care of me and was apologetic but the bad experience and the lack of customer skills along with quality deters me away from buying my dream car which is the GTR since I no longer want to deal with Nissan.  If you're going to buy a car with a CVT, go with Honda or Toyota, their customer service and warranty program are more customer friendly not to mention that most dealerships will work with you and not treat you as if they don't want to deal with you.\",\n",

The CVT transmission is whining already and we've received a recall for transmission module claiming that reprogramming will remove transmission slippage.  Reprogramming a module will NOT fix transmission slip, just shifting calibration, really fear what thats gonna cost if it begins to slip. I work for a major car rental company and we have over 100+ Rogues just at our location and most of them have the same issue with popping in the steering.  Blind spots everywhere, you can't see while turning corners, backing up, and cars near you while driving.  The high front fenders and large mirrors block your view when cornering. The passenger side mirror is so distorted that you can't make any judgment or see what's in the reflection.  Make sure you ride in back seat before buying, it's an extremely rough ride over the slightest bumps, especially while city driving.  The road noise in back seat area is extreme but milder in front seat.  One of the most annoying things is the auto locks, you can program them in the Pathfinder to unlock when you put it in park, but you have to completely turn off vehicle to unlock all doors.  The best thing about this car is that it is my wife's car. I only have to ride in it part time and when the transmission goes, she gets to pay for the car again.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \" I purchased my brand new Toyota Tundra SR5 double cab 4.6L in 2012 from a local dealership. Two weeks ago my check engine and TRC OFF lights came on so I rushed to a nearby Toyota dealership an hour later the service tech approached me to explain that my secondary air injection valves were closed reason why my truck would only get up to 40mph and felt bogged down. He then informed me it could be a matter of resetting the computer and the valves could reset themselves and I will just be out $100.00 for the computer testing. Or my air injection valve assembly could be bad. Another hour later he returns to tell me resetting the computer did not work and I would need to replace the air injection valves if I got it repaired there and right away it would be $2,500.00 if not $2,800.00. Between all of this fiasco they are trying to sell me a  new truck I need to mention. So after me asking a million questions he then says its nothing I did NO NEGLECT on my part to my truck it's a manufacturer issue but unfortunately my truck is not covered under the recall/warranty. The recall/warranty is only on the 5.7L Tundras so after lots of research I have found Toyota has had many issues with this valve system since early 2000.I went to the dealership where I bought the truck and was told unfortunately I just have really bad luck and I could be 1 out of 10,000 people this happens to then of course they kept me their trying to sell me a new truck. I do need to mention my truck is still at the dealership that diagnosed my truck originally. Then I'm told we can not help you at dealership level you have to call corporate. I call corporate and they made a case but then of course pointed the finger at the dealership. Bottom line Toyota YOU bought a faulty manufactured part YOU need to take ownership of it, it is not my fault your vehicles have rust issues, break issues, airbag issues and air injection valve issues. I have never been so rudely mistreated like this by a company that supposedly has great customer service...NOT TRUE at all. They care about one thing and one thing only their bottom line and profit. This was the first Toyota I have ever owned and needless to say it will be my last. My truck had 130k miles on it and I owe 5k on it, now I have to put 3k into it....BS!\",\n",

As the computer learned the driving habits, it's supposed to adjust (fine tune) the transmission over a period of time.  Well, this fine-tuning thing didn't improve the drive.  I took the car to the dealer 3 times.  The dealer said they couldn't find anything wrong during the first two sessions.  They offered to reset the computer.  Finally, the 3rd session, the service manager finally admitted that this is a know problem, but he couldn't do anything about it.  I tested drive another brand new Sienna and it's pretty bad as well.  I'm an engineer, and crying and regretting buying this car.  FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS BUY A FLAWED SIENNA.  PLEASE STAY AWAY.  I REGRET NOT BUYING ANOTHER HONDA ODYSSEY.  Here are my problems:1.\\tThis occurred five times - When driving on the street at 40-45 mph and slowing down to a stop on a red light at the intersection, the car jerks (stutters like the transmission or drive train gears can’t transition) significant enough for my wife on the front passenger seat to ask what’s wrong with the car.  The car had 60 miles on the odometer when the first occurrence happened.  The car now has 275 miles on the odometer.2.\\tI do not feel any acceleration for a second or so then it kicked in with a big gear kick, especially when:a.\\t I go over speed bumps at a slow speed, and press on the throttle after going over the bump.b.\\t I lift off the throttle approaching a corner, and pressing on the throttle half way through the corner. Feels like the gear slipped (engine whines, but no acceleration) then exerted a big gear kick.  3.\\tI noticed that while I turn left on curve road (in the neighborhood) around 15-20 mph, the gear stutters a little bit, enough to feel like the wheel hits loose gravels.4.\\tIn general, it appears the engine whines a lot when accelerating from stop.  It feels like there isn’t much torque.5.\\tOverall the driving experience for the past couple of weeks has been dreadful.  Spending a lot of hard earned money for a car that constantly reminds me of problems is not a happy state of mind.I tried my brother-in-law’s 2014 Sienna, and it does not exhibit any of the problems above.\",\n",

We have had it cleaned, replace the filters every month, ozone treatment , you name it... still smells. Nissan has no idea.... The latest, two parallel  cracks have appeared on top of the passenger's airbag.  Contacted Nissan they say we will pay for the part but you have to pay over $400 worth of labor. WHAT??  You are accepting responsibility for the  problem but won't take care of it 100%.. Even though YOU placed a cheap plastic dashboard on my $50K vehicle??? I will seriously NEVER ever purchase another NISSAN again and would not recommend anyone to do so. Cheap product - High Price- Horrible reviews - class action Lawsuits on similar issue as mine..

We made it to Colorado perfectly when out of NOWHERE our transmission started acting funny, it had a hard time shifting gears and once it got up to 4th it wouldn't maintain 60... then my husband would press on the gas and NOTHING happened. We pulled over, called a tow truck and had no idea what was to come. Stranded in Colorado with our 14 month old son.... we got the news it would cost Nissan $6900 to fix. Yup. You read that right. Needed a new transmission. New c02 censor. Something with the exhaust. The wiring had melted. New catalytic converter. Oh and the timing chain that had just been fixed was also now messed up. To top it all of, we had this van for less than two weeks. We are at a loss for words. And please, don't buy this van. Apparently Nissan KNOWS there's troubles with their transmissions but they've done nothing about it. Do yourself a favor and just say no. Won't ever buy a Nissan again.

I walked up to my car after shopping at WalMart for 40 min. only to find that it had started up by itself, and must have been running while I was in the store with the doors locked.  Upon entering the car, a yellow caution light was flashing near the odometer.  I read many consumer complaints and found another person complaining of the same problem and was told that it can happen when the remote entry keypad is pushed twice after exiting the vehicle.  After reading many other customer complaints about various issues with 2013-2015 brakes not working while driving (Yikes!), driver doors not unlocking, and front seats making loud noises while driving, I wish I had read those complaints before purchasing this vehicle.

They only try to blame the customer for their defects.UPDATE after 30 days of driving - The sound system is terrible.  My Sienna minivan had a JBL sound system which was great, but the Highlander has a cheap sound system with a horrible muffled sound.  After driving the car a little while, you will notice that the interior has many cheap parts!!  The floor \"carpet\" is actually felt, not carpet, and some of the dash has plastic parts.  The front seats and angled headrest are very uncomfortable on longer rides.  Wish I could trade my new XLE in for a well made car that matches the price I paid.  The quality just isn\\'t in the 2016 Highlander for the high price.   Still disappointed.',\n",

Good gas mileage (Nissan claims it to be 33 on highways and 26 on city roads)2. Additional seat for occasional usage of my family needsEver since I bought this car I am getting very low gas mileage and tried to work with local dealer as well as Nissan for resolution but no satisfactory results-1. I am getting ~ 19 MPG in city driving and getting 24-26 MPG on highway driving which is about 8 MPG lower than what is claimed at the time vehicle is sold or advertised.2. Multiple visits to dealer and gave them gas mileage readings as per their requirements. Dealer did software upgrade but I don't see they did anything reasonable which convince that it should make it better. After multiple visits and fulfilling whatever they asked for (even waiting for more then 4-5 Hrs. in one occasion) no outcome and dealer asked me to call Nissan customer care.3. I called Nissan customer care and got Case opened but here also it was completely unsatisfactory4. Nissan representative told me that based on dealer checks, everything is working as expected and after lot of persuasion she agreed that her supervisor will call5. Supervisor called me and she told me the same story that as per dealer it is within company specifications. when asked what are company specifications and this is lower than what you advertise, no answer and keep on repeating that this is within company specifications. This was completely unacceptable and no help provided by Nissan and after I told that I have to go to Better Business Bureau, she had no effect. Seems Nissan is very proud of their legal team and a mere customer can't do anything against them. So if you are buying any Nissan vehicle and you are unlucky to get a bad vehicle, my experience is that both Dealer and Nissan will leave you to deal with it.I would recommend to not go with Nissan or Cherry Hill Nissan dealership.\",\n",

Everything about that car...5 stars. I bought a 2009 limited V6 3.5 and it is a nightmare. The suspension recall fix involves an epoxy seal on the links which make the adjustable links...unadjustable. meaning...if the rear is out of alignment. ..you have to pay $500+ to have the recall fix done again. I have never had to do anything other than maintenance to my toyotas. This one...3rd pair of shocks...this time i used monroe shocks. ER brake cable...drive train assembly  ($1400 part). Blower motor...Such a disappointment... I have 150000 miles on the odometer and it runs great. Done with it.After I updated my review I started experience more problems with this car. I had to have the rotors resurfaced again.  Problems with the steering also started to progress. Recalls for the master switch for driver's side window and wiper motor. Toyota stopped making their own parts in 2006...huge mistake. This car became a full time job. I am a car guru and visit dealerships 24/7 chose to get rid of this car before it depreciated any more. I had a hard time finding a dealership that would give me decent money for the trade. The day I traded in the 2009 my 2005 limited (not a v6 and a lot less options) was worth 2000.00 more. I have to say that I am disappointed in the Toyota Corporation. Their business decisions have affected their automobiles. Putting their dealerships in the position of not being able to be honest with customers about their cars has enabled me not to trust Toyota corporation anymore. I was fortunate to be able to put my car up on a rack anytime I needed to check anything. Many people don't have that luxury. I see people driving their cars on the road with the suspension recall and the rear wheels out of toe. ..scary. If I get the opportunity to talk to them most say that they did not know because they had the recall fix done! I take excellent care of my cars...it's a lemon.Since the last time I reviewed this car I look at the rear suspension of other 2009 rav4 cars on the road or parking lots. I have not found one yet that the rear wheels are not out out of toe. I even speak to other owners and inform them about this make and model. This car has a lot of safety issues. Why Toyota thinks it is OK to drive a car around with the rear wheels out of toe is beyond me. I will not own or recommend Toyota to anyone again. ...they have lost a longtime customer and consumer promoting their products.\",\n",

Maybe if you are in the BMW service business.Depreciation  is shocking. $75,000 to $25,000 in four years, even with low miles. After six years you cannot give it away.My advice is, if you must have the BMW X5 make sure to sell it before the manufacturers warranty runs out.  It’s actually is a great drive but not worth the hassle or high cost of ownership. ',\n",

The mpg meter will not register but, at last I could see it's estimates I was getting about 1-12 mpg. I then started smelling antifreeze leaking but the dealer could not find the leak. It was the top rail of the radiator seeping and, I had to pay twice to replace it out of warranty. The turning radius is very poor and, you cannot see the steering wheels controls at night. During the day you cannot see the Bose radio controls about high noon as the sun prevents it. I've replaced both steering arms, rear bearings, fixed a leak at the firewall causing water to come into the passenger side floor and, replaced the struts all this was around 90,000 miles. My car now is shutting off at will with codes P1283, PO726, PO797 and, the transmission will not go into fifth gear though serviced at 30,000 intervals. I am now at 127,000 miles and just replaced leaking defective valve covers(causing the oil to reach the plugs) $600.00. I just tuned it up and replaced the fuel injectors $786.00, just replaced the crank & cam shaft sensors, fuel air ratio valve, mass air flow sensor,(2) o2 sensors, all the ignition coils pack $1,400.00 and, I still have not got the car running as as stated it shuts off at will. I will NEVER own another Nissan as when they started making them in the USA, something is definitely wrong. They were excellent cars when made in Japan as I was with them since they were Datsuns.\",\n",

Not even a month of owning it and maybe around a thousand mile, my low oil light indicator turns on but there is still another 10k miles until next oil change, so decided to do an additional oil change at my expense since BMW refused to do one for me. At about 2-3k miles again, going to Austin for the weekend from Houston, and my low oil light come back on again. Took it back to the dealer and they added over 2 quarts of oil. I asked them why the oil consumption, and their response was it's normal. A month or two, rolls out and the Aux. Pump goes out. No problem since it's still under warranty and your driving on a brand new loner car for 3 weeks, since they were on backorder from Germany. A couple of month go by without any issues and then the high battery consumption light come. They replaced the battery and a couple of module and returned the vehicle back in a couple of day, no problem. A couple of months go by again, and bam, the battery light come back again, took it back to the dealer, they kept the vehicle for over a month this time, saying they couldn't find the issue and when they finally did, it turned out to be a right front door handle, that would not dormant. Happy to get the vehicle back, when I get a letter from BMW about a big campaign(another word for a RECALL) and to bring the vehicle in to the dealer. Brought the vehicle to the dealer, and they tell me that it will stay in the shop for a couple of weeks since it's a big campaign for Injector, Vacuum system, Etc. So again, they kept vehicle at the dealer for a month. I'm beginning to get aggravated  with vehicle already and am thinking of replacing it already. But instead, decided to keep it, after all, it's a very nice SUV, M-packaged with all the bells and whittles. Just about 2 weeks ago we decided to take a road trip for spring break, and drive to California. Long story short, we broke down in between Bakersfield and San Jose, ruined our Vacation and cost me over $2000 in unexpected repairs bill. The Starter went out, the coils went out and this is ONLY with just a little over 30K MILES!!!!! Folks, I LOVE BMW, having and owing 135i, (2) 335i, x5 3.0, and now the X5 50i, By all means , Stay away from the X5 50i.\",\n",

We test drove a 3rd gen Tacoma at the local dealership, which after a 20 mile trip decided the truck would be a pretty good replacement for us empty nesters. Good mpg, reliability etc.. Totally drank the Kool Aid. We ordered our TRD-OR 4 dr lb and waited 4 months for it to arrive. We took our first trip- a camping trip that took us over the divide to south western Montana. Not a ton of gear- lightly loaded I would say. We were SHOCKED that to climb the grade the tranny dropped to 4the and 3rd gear, and it redlined the entire uphill climb! Our 100 mile trip to the campsite returned a whopping 16mpg. Stock truck, mostly highway and then 10 offroad. My offroad mpg was better then the highway.  That should have been a sign. Then the tranny starting shifting erratically, up-down, up-down.. It would never hold a gear. Took it to the dealer to perform the TSB update on the tranny- service department at first said \"No TSB exists\". I had to do an internet search and show it to them. TSB flash fixed it for about 500 miles, then it reverted back to erratic shifting. Also- dealer said mpg\\'s \"Will get better after 2,000 miles or so\".. Third problem- the hood support braces are glued to the hood. 75% of the glue points failed, and my truck had a wavy hood at highway speed. If the sun glint was just right, it was like having a disco ball in the cab. Very annoying. Fourth problem- after 6 months and 14,000 miles the truck differential started howling and moaning. At this point the avg MPG was 16 (yes- 16), even after a long highway trip from Montana to Ohio. The dealer refused to address the hood- they said \"Normal Characteristic of the truck\", my tranny still shifted erratically and the car was unsuited for long distance travel. We had it. We drove over to the Chevy dealer, test drove a 1500 Silverado with a 6.2L V8 and 8spd tranny and got a decent trade on the Tacoma. No shifting issues, no wavy hood, no groaning differential and I\\'m getting 19mpg on average. Toyota really duffed this Tacoma. Not worth the hype, the price or the hassle.',\n",

              " {'sequence': \" I wish I could recommend this car to others given the breakthrough fuel cell technology and the ramifications of this technology on the state of the environment, but I simply can't. Within the second month of leasing this car, we found the Mirai leaking coolant onto our garage floor. Upon taking it to the dealership, we discovered that a pebble from the road went through the front grill and bust a hole in our coolant tank, causing this issue. The design bug is likely due to the way that the Mirai takes in air from the front grill to supply the fuel cell with oxygen, exposing many of the internal components to the external environment. The worst thing about this issue is how Toyota decided to resolve it: refusing to acknowledge their design mistake, forcing us to pay $3000-4000 for the repair (to pay for their liquid gold coolant), since their own design mistakes are apparently not covered by the warranty with the car. And on top of the insulting response from them, they are able to offer no guarantee of fixing this problem in the design, which means the car is still unprotected from any stone on the road. Our dealership has told us that several other customers (with the 2018 Mirai) have come in with the same issue, meaning that this is a widespread problem. Avoid this car, if possible.\",\n",

I have almost been involved in a serious accident as a result. Toyota can\\'t seem to get to the bottom of this matter. In the interim I am very frustrated as I am getting the run around between the manufacturer and the dealer. I plan on pursuing NJ Lemon Law in attempt to have my car replaced.After pursuing Lemon law and having my car inspected by a Toyota Corporate mechanic I was told that the issue is due to a faulty design in the fuel tank. When my car is parked even on a slight incline (in my driveway) with a full tank of gas, gas will leak out and compromise the charcoal canister. When the onboard computer system senses that there is a issue with the fuel system, it is designed to automatically shut the car as a safety precaution \"even while the vehicle is in motion\". Toyota then advised me not to fill my tank more then half until a solution to this problem is remedied.  I was told that all 2012, 2013 and 2014 Toyota Camry\\'s (along with some other Toyota models) have the same faulty design in the tank.  As such, getting me into another  2013 or 2014 vehicle would not solve the problem. My claim was therefore denied. I am currently eagerly waiting for a class action suit against Toyota. I have since gotten rid of my Camry and purchased a 2014 Honda Accord. As miserable as I was with the Camry, that\\'s how much I am truly loving my Accord! My negative experience with Toyota has and continues to spread and have an impact. I have since convinced many coworkers, friends and family members (many who have been long time loyal Toyota customers)  to switch over to the new Honda Accord. They too all seem \"thrilled\" with their Accord. The overall feedback I get is that the car is a much smoother drive, hugs the road much better specifically in inclement weather conditions. The also enjoy the plush interior design which makes the car feel very homey (vs. Toyota\\'s cheap interior and hard plastic feel and design), along with dual climate control and better fuel economy. The Accord also includes numerous safety features even in the lx (base) models, (which Toyota doesn\\'t even offer as a upgrade) including hill assist. If you are in the market for purchasing a sedan do yourself a favor and test drive the Accord before even considering the Camry. There is good reason why Toyota had to redesign the Camry 2 years earlier then originally anticipated....',\n",

Fast forward to Dec. of 2016 when looking for a safe, low cost family vehicle and I ended up with a 2007 Nissan Maxima.  I even purchased this from Infiniti  dealership thinking I would have a road worthy vehicle. (even AS IS) Well, 15 minutes after picking up the car, the check engine light came on. After being completely rejected by the dealership,  spending over $800 to date, it was determined this vehicle had a well documented defective timing chain issue that resulted in a class action filing back in 2013.  (Kobe Falco v. Nissan North America Inc et al)  The next step is to fork out a further $2500 to fix the chain on a 10 year old vehicle or take my losses. Nissan (nor Infiniti) will never have my business under any circumstances ever again.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': \" There's a lot you need to know about this car before buying it. Firstly, if you DO buy it buy it new but Ideally lease it. Toyota has gotten incredibly shifty about their warranties and their reliability has dropped. I am reviewing this car based on owning it and also based on working on the brand professionally. In the year that I bought this car used, my dashboard has melted and been replaced by Toyota under warranty. My engine burns 1.5 quarts of oil per 12,000 miles due to faulty piston ring design. They will not cover it due to a lack of oil change receipts and the nature of it being purchased used. The gas pedal had a recall that was performed due to it functioning incorrectly. All Toyota Water pumps will leak antifreeze which is considered normal by the manufacturer. The sun visor in this particular model is held up by a metal clip and actually mine fell down while I was driving on the interstate one day. My radio was designed without the JBL option and you cannot upgrade after you purchase your vehicle. The wiring harnesses are not included and they will not allow it to be performed. The radio I was stuck with has major issues - as do many of them on that model. The cd players don't read properly and I went through five of them both new and used. You will be unable to do anything other than upgrade to an aftermarket radio designed specifically for this vehicle. The interior design of this build was built incredibly cheap and lacks durability in all senses. The alignment of the drivers seat is off to the right so eventually you will notice the left side of your seat wear out. The air conditioning system has a bad habit of growing mold and smelling like death due to evaporator moisture. Toyota's legendary paint has once again failed on my vehicle. The clear coat is paper thin and scratching everywhere. Also in newer vehicles, you will find stone chips and rail marks on every single car, even new ones. Trade in value has dropped horribly with this model and I'm financially underwater on this transaction. Toyota factory strut mounts are notorious for failure - especially the drivers side front on this model. The drivers side axle is also an issue and has a tendency to make noise and fail. The transmission software on these cars has been flashed several thousand times due to bad programming decisions and hesitations. Every time the car is at the shop there is a new recall open on it. My rear view mirror peeled in half and I ended up replacing it with one from a 1999 Toyota Camry. I actually have stopped working on new cars recently, due to the unreliability of the automotive industry of today.\",\n",

The CVT burned up completely and the car is immobile. There is no additional warranty on drive train or engine beyond 3 years and 36,000 miles. Upon reading up on CVT issues for Nissan, it is obvious this transmission is notorious. Many, many drivers have had the same experience as my daughter. The transmission is not repairable due to the technology used in the CVT. A replacement transmission is around $3000, if you are lucky. It is simply cheaper for us to get rid of the car to buy a replacement vehicle. Before purchasing this car, research Nissan CVT issues.',\n",

The worst thing was, the dealer did fix because of warranty but after 2000 miles  it broke again. I heard that once your transmission is broken you will always have the same problem unless you put the new one. STAY away FROM NISSAN CVT.

              " {'sequence': \" Well here it goes...I don't complain much, but Ive had it with my 2009 Nissan Altima. The steering lock column has failed on me, leaving the vehicle dead in its tracks.  After researching the issue, Ive learned that it has been and continues to be a major issue on this make and model. I reside in Minnesota and this happened at night with the temperature of -5 and wind-chills at -30 leaving my wife and I stranded 30 miles from home and 45 miles from the nearest Nissan dealer. The $700 part fails to disengage from the steering column and therefore renders the car useless. After numerous conversations with Nissan consumer affairs I have yet to get an answer. Apparently they extended the warranty for this part, but go figure...It happened to me after the warranty expired.  In doing more research I have learned that unless a certified Nissan mechanic diagnosis the issue they(consumer affairs) cant or wont(not sure) do anything for me. Furthermore, the part is the size of a deck cards and riveted so I cant replace the part myself. So, long story short...$700 part, $300 in labor, $150 towing bill for a part that is essentially useless. What has me upset is that Nissan knowingly has not placed a recall on the part even though there have been thousands of issues directly related to this issue....Not to mention its on the National Highway Safety Dept list of hazards.  There will never be another Nissan in my garage...ever!\",\n",

I barely used it, it was my backup/weekend car and for 2 yrs I have the car, I've only put in 18K on it.  I had the water pump replaced on Feb 2015 by a Toyota tech that does outside job and I did replace the serpentine belt on Dec 2014.  Decide to use  this car to work one day and noticed my temperature gauge start hitting hot, park my car to safe area and check my coolant reservoir, it was empty.  I remember checking it 2 days ago, it was full.  As I remove my radiator cap, there was no coolant in the radiator,  put water in it since I did not have any coolant with me and decide to take it to one of the mechanic I go to, it was close by to the area where I was at.  I did check my oil and it was still fine, did not see any water oil mixture.  As I've mention the issue to the mechanic, he already knew the problem with this models.  Strip head bolt and coolant is going through it or either leak back,  recommended engine replacement.  Took my car home and used my daily driver car, 92 camry with 279K (original engine).  Same day, I've contact the Toyota tech mechanic, he had mentioned to me that this has been an issue with this car's but usually it's about 130K.  I was aware of this issue a yr  after I bought the car, google engine performance, I was  hoping it would last me up to 130K.  I would stay away from 2.4L Toyota engine from 2002-2010, bad engine engineering,  either a strip head bold or piston ring issues, coming from the Toyota tech mechanic.  I will have to replace my motor since I don't want another car payment, hoping it will last me at least 4-5 yrs just to get my money back. It will cost me about 4K with the Toyota tech doing the work. 1/2016: I end up having a rebuilt motor put inn, cost me about $2300 for the rebuilt motor and luckily the mechanic charge me only $450 for installation. Had my clutch replace. I have put in about 10K on rebuilt motor, no issue at this time. Hoping to have this car for awhile and have no other engine issue.\",\n",

This is my 3rd Toyota Tundra.  2006, 2010, and this one I\\'m rating is 2016 Tundra Crewmax Limited.  I love this truck.  But I am rating this a \"1\" star for the following reasons.  And please, read this if you are considering purchasing one and this tip to do on the test drive.  I purchased my 2016 Crewmax new and at about 1,000 miles the truck started vibrating at approximately 48-50 mph when it was in 6th gear (overdrive).  The Tundra is a 6 speed automatic (overdrive).  I took it to the dealer I purchased it from and the mechanic diagnosed and verified my problem.  This is where the problems begin.  He then got on the phone to \"Toyota Tech Line\" and they had him \"move the tires around\", which he did.  Bottom line.  It didn\\'t fix the vibration around 48-50 mph.  So I met with the \"regional corporate dude\" who went for a ride with me and he even verified the issue but said that the \"new one\" we drove on the lot did it worse so it was classified as \"characteristic\".  What???  Worse than  mine??  That my friends is \"corporate speak\" for \"blow off\" / \"cover up\".  So, I took it to another Toyota Dealer and had the mechanic go for a ride.  He verified and diagnosed that I had a problem.  He even took his laptop computer on a ride after speaking to the Toyota Tech Line and they said to hit the button on his laptop computer every time he felt the problem.  He came back and told me he \"hit the button\" over 100 times.  Thus..  Houston, we have a problem verified by 2 Toyota mechanics and the \"regional dude\".  I am heading back for one more time to attempt to get it fixed.  The problem is actually getting worse.  I currently have about 8,000 miles on my truck.  As I stated earlier, I am a complete \"Toyota Fan Boy\", but the sheer and utter disrespect shown not only to me, but the Toyota Certified Mechanics who are working hard and wanting to fix the problem shown by the \"corporate regional guy\" is unacceptable and something I would expect from GM, Ford, or Chrysler.  But Toyota.... No way.  I know they try to \"care\" about their customers, but with the way I have been \"jerked around\" and humiliated by the \"corporate regional guy\" has taken its toll.  I guess that\\'s why God created \"Lemon Law Attorneys\".  So, PLEASE READ THIS.....  IF YOU ARE THINKING OF BUYING A TOYOTA TUNDRA, PLEASE, ON YOUR TEST RIDE, GO APPROX. 48-50 MPH AND LET IT BE IN 6TH GEAR AND HOLD IT THERE.  If you feel the vibration, RUN.  Know that they are not going to fix it and call it \"characteristic\".  If you can live with that, then so be it.  But, don\\'t say I didn\\'t try to inform and help you in this matter.  In fact, according to the 2 mechanics that worked on the truck, apparently there are more people than me \"squeaking\" about this problem.   It is a problem / issue!  Best wishes!UPDATE:  3/26/18:  I filed a \"Lemon Law\" suit and \"settled\" with Toyota and have since gotten rid of this 2016 Tundra.  I have purchased another 2018 Tundra.  Please be aware.  This 2018 is also doing the exact same thing as my 2016 did, but not quite as bad.  I am not mechanical but I know what I \"hear\" and \"feel\".  The Toyota factory trained technicians have stated it\\'s a torque converter issue and Toyota just won\\'t fix it and would rather fight you than fix it.  If you can live with the vibration, then otherwise it\\'s a GREAT truck.  Remember:  BUYER BEWARE!',\n",

Width of rear rail gate narrow not good for cargo. Hood moves like it isn't shut on high speed interstate driving over 60 mph . When checked its shut. Looking for mid size SUV run the other way!!\",\n",

              " {'sequence': ' This is the 4th Nissan I\\'ve owned. I stuck with them because I have loved my Nissans, and I am all about brand loyalty. My last (2013) Sentra was pretty great, so I decided to go the same route with this one. unfortunately, not only did the dealership stop being helpful once I signed that paper, (and at times were actually detrimental to the process, verging on rude and ignoring my requests to get my contract and financial paperwork (Which I don\\'t have 45 days later), leading me to miss my first payment) but this car is awful.  The navigation system turns off about 500 feet before my destination, leaving me to guess or impede traffic to try and see house/building numbers. The USB has to reload my USB drive (where I listen to all my music) every time the car starts, and skips the music as it \"index\"es 1-3% at a time (and sometimes doesn\\'t at all). Most of the time I reach my destination before I can actually enjoy any of my own music.  The dashboard is half pointless, as it took me almost an hour to figure out how to scroll through the settings list. The center console is half the size of my last one, but there\\'s a huge space between that and my cup holders- what a pointless design. The buttons on the steering wheel are tiny, leading me to question how those with large hands or fingers are able to hit one. EVERY TIME the temperature is under 40 degrees F, I get an Alert saying there are cold temperatures outside--underneath the temperature that is stationary. So if the winter temperatures affect the performance in my car so much that I get a warning about it...I LIVE IN NEW YORK, and am extremely disappointed. The acceleration makes my car sound like it wants to die and is working twice as hard as it should be (I am not a slam on the pedal type of person). The windshield wipers don\\'t lift up due to a design mistake- again- living in new York with ice and snow, this is a MAJOR flaw. Driving over 20 mph, my passengers side whistles and I feel like a dog listening to a high-pitched sound (I don\\'t know if it is the window? mirror? Having the window doesn\\'t change it or alter the noise, and I have to turn on music to be able to drive long distances without going crazy from the whistle. The blind spot notifications and back up cam are great- there was a big improvement over the 2013, and I love the pockets on the front of the seats. However I\\'m not joking when I say if I could turn it in now, I would. I hate this car, and I will never purchase another Nissan thanks to this experience, car, and the (and the previous for same attempt of purchase) dealership I worked with this year. After 11 years of owning Nissans (and another 3 in the future of leasing this POS), I\\'m upset about every single interaction that has taken place, on top of the car. If the car were great and the dealership sucked, whatever. This car is awful. I absolutely do not recommend it, and if you HAVE to get a Nissan, go for at least the Altima.',\n",

              " {'sequence': ' After owning nothing but Camrys since 1989, and being completely satisfied with them, we decided to \"upgrade\" to the Toyota \"Flagship\", assuming that it would be nicer than the Camrys.  This was the biggest car buying mistake of my life!  Our 2014 Avalon Limited has the harshest ride and the most road noise of any car we have ever owned.  We refer to it as \"The Turnip\" because we feel the ride and noise would be what you would expect from a turnip truck used on a farm to transport vegetables.  The seats are about as comfortable as sitting on a sheet of plywood.  Understand that we think the deep metallic red Avalon is one of the prettiest cars on the road.  We get a lot of compliments on the appearance of the car, and I always try to sell it to the people making the compliment.However, when new people ride in the car, the comment is something like, \"What were you thinking?  Did you even drive this thing before you bought it?\"  Regrettably, I didn\\'t drive the car; I went entirely on Toyota\\'s reputation for quality and the terrific Avalon reputation for a quiet, almost luxury car ride, in an affordable vehicle.Toyota says they redefined the ride to appeal to a younger (40-ish) group of potential buyers.  I really don\\'t see where a \"neck-snapping\" noisy ride would appeal to people in any age group.A few other complaints: 1. Navigation system is already out of date; 2. Analog and digital speed indications are different; 3. Rattles are starting to appear; 4. Sound system is very unimpressive compared to systems in our other cars. I have tried several times to trade this car for something (almost anything) else.  Car dealers KNOW the Avalon\\'s new reputation, and the trade-in value is below the low end of the Kelly Blue Book range of values.  The saddest event was when I test drove a Ford F-150 pickup truck and the ride quality and lack of road noise was FAR superior to the Avalon.Summary: If you feel you simply MUST consider this car, take it for an EXTENDED test drive before signing the paperwork!!  Drive down a highway at 60 MPH and just listen to the road noise!!  There doesn\\'t seem to be adequate sound insulation in the body.  READ READ READ the reviews!!!Better yet, buy something else.Update:  After trying several times, we have not been able to get rid of this car.  Dealers know that this is not the quiet comfortable car that Avalon used to be.  The car has very low mileage and is in absolutely flawless condition, but we have not been able to get within $2000 of KBB or NADA trade in value.  This car was a very poor choice.Update 2/17:  We still own this car because we have been unable to get any kind of a reasonable trade-in on the vehicle.  We keep the car as a spare when someone in the family needs a car when their car is in the shop, etc..  This is not a problem since we have four cars for two drivers.  We purchased a new all-wheel-drive SUV last November.  Sadly, the SUV rides far better than the Avalon and, unbelievably, is quieter.  The most annoying thing about this Avalon is that it could have been a wonderful car if they had only left it alone and kept the fantastic quiet comfortable ride for which Avalon was know up to the 2013 model.  I enjoy reading other Avalon reviews where the Avalon is compared to \"the Flintstone\\'s car with granite wheels\".  At least I get a couple laughs out of the $35000 I threw away on this car.Update 2/18:Because we refuse to take a financial beating on \"The Turnip\", we still own it.  We just couldn\\'t find a dealer, including Toyota, who would even give us the \"trade in\" value toward list price on another car.  We have two SUV\\'s that ride much better than the Avalon, and are much quieter.  The Avalon needed a complete 4-wheel brake job, including rotors, at 31,000 miles!  Never had a car before that required a brake job at such a low mileage (usually, we get 60,000 or more miles out of brakes).Again I will state that this could have been a wonderful car if Toyota maintained the quiet and excellent ride quality that it was known for before the 2013 model.  BTW, I bought a Subaru Outback for about 70% of the cost of the Avalon.  The Outback is a pure joy to own: better, quieter ride than the Avalon!  Shame on you, Toyota!!',\n",

              " {'sequence': \" !!AVOID THIS MODEL!!! - Backstory : Based on a good amount of research it was hard to deny the overall positive press this model was getting. I had a 2012 528i that was out of warranty and have had BMW’s since my early 20's so when the lease incentives hit bargain basement levels, I jumped in. Sadly, I should have remembered a life preserver.Month 1 - 2 weeks out of service - hybrid battery/charging system warningMonth 2 - 2 weeks out of service - hybrid battery/charging system warningMonth 3 - 2 days out of service - hybrid battery/cold weather use warning.So, 2.2 months, over a month out of service total. Great start to my ownership experience.However, it gets worse. We have had very cold temperatures over the last two weeks, even for where I live in Richmond, VA. Days and nights well below freezing. I get that batteries don’t retain full charge in cold weather, but this one was only charging about 80% max and depleted even that very quickly...that is...when it actually allowed for electric operation. You see, what they don’t tell you is that the fully battery operation is not available in lower temperatures! Yep, that’s right. So, for all you who, like me, thought you could pretty much commute via full battery, well....guess what, ya can’t when it is cold out! Sad part is, this is considered normal according to my dealership. What burns my ass up even more is that a warning light stays lit on your dash and on your Nav screen to remind you that you paid $$$$ for a system you can’t use.Other things they don’t tell you - - -This is a 320e at best. You are going to deplete your battery relatively quickly (14 miles max in full electric mode) and once depleted, guess what? You aren’t running on 248 advertised horsepower, you are running on 180....with several hundred pounds on top of a similar 320i model! Battery regeneration isn’t enough for spirited driving or even multiple full throttle launches back to back! So, BMW has pulled the wool over my eyes, just don’t let it do the same to you.Other things I have found out by myself - - -$575 for side window sun shades? WTH? They are MANUAL!$2650 for Blind Spot/Lane Departure/and Frontal Impact Warning and a front/rear parking camera/sensor system with around view camera? Have they lost their MINDS?!? Worse yet, all you are paying for is warning lights and a shake of the steering wheel! Ridiculous and a waste of money unless you live urban and park on the street.So, as of this writing BMW USA has contacted me because they know that the cold driving issues (no full electric power) are an issue along with the horsepower claims.  It should say 248 MAX hp, because it is rare that you have it to use.  I have asked them to take it back.  A little over two months of disappointment.\",\n",

They need to realize the true facts about their American made ford parts being assemble in Mexico is false advertisement.  I have a Toyota body, with who knows how many cheap parts are used.  I will never by a Toyota again, the sad thing is who would want to by any highlanders, the trade in value doesn\\'t come close to being the amount it should be.  Complete buyers remorse.  Stay away from Toyota\\'s.  Buy a Ford, It is American, by a Chevy it is American.  But if I were to by an European car.  It will be a true European Car.   Not happy about the true facts about Toyota after the purchase.  Lesson Learned.  I would come out a whole lot better if I turned the car in due to not holding their value for the price you will pay.  Not to mention, Toyota Finance is repo happy, I think the reason is they want to make payments teetering on the edge of way too high so people default.   I say let them have it if they won\\'t work with you and be reasonable...After all the parts are not Toyota parts.  They are assembled in different places in the US, but mostly Mexico.  So there you have it, the absolute truth about Toyota and their high repo problem with Toyota Finance.  If you still want one after reading this statement of fact.  Do not use Toyota Finance, they are prideful of the millions of 2015-16 repo action.  Funny, even the dealership expressed or said and I quote,\" this SUV will last you a long time if it\\'s not repossessed first.\" I should have questioned him on that statement but at the time I thought surely he is kidding?',\n",

I stalled once at a turn getting onto I-95 and went into full panic attack since I had my children in the car. I managed to get it to the side of the road and after an hour it came on and drove like nothing happened.  Brought it to the garage several times explaining my problems.  They replaced the o2 sensor, fuel pump, battery you name it and the problem never resolved and was extremely apparent it wasn't fixed only when i tried to make any trip longer than 3 hours.  This is a dangerous problem and if i see anyone at any store get out of a nissan rogue I will make them aware of my problems so maybe i could save a family from dying if they choose to take this family car on any vacation.  oh and come to find out it was a faulty transmission all along...I want to rid myself f this vehicle since I am scared to drive it again after all of the same posts i have seen from other families with the same exact problems of this 2013 rogue.  what a nightmare...I always bought Nissan, not after this last experience and a complete waste of my money.\",\n",

Look into the class actions law suite regarding melting dash board and the concerns around safety.  Nissan refused to replace mine because it is out of warranty. They are currently involved in a Class Action suit that goes to trial this summer. This is not an isolated problem.  There are many reports of the 2008 and 2009 years with this issue.  It is truly a safety problem.  The dash gets so shiny that when driving into the sun you cannot see.  Nissan as well as the other Japanese auto makers are fully aware of the substandard dashboards.  Toyota stepped up and extended the warranty on both the Toyota and Lexus brands. Nissan refuses to do anything unless they lose the class action suit and even then I fully expect them to drag their feet.

HOWEVER, the frame started having significant rust after just a few years and was causing some expensive repairs. Fire shield rusted off and was removed. Now the massive skid plate bracket rusted off. Toyota service just removed the entire unrepairable skid plate due to the level of rust. There is nothing left to attach to. The mechanics said they were afraid to scrape or chip any more rust because they were afraid that other stuff would fall of and make the vehicle even more unsafe to drive. They indicated that this is absolutely excessive rust on the frame that should not happen. Their official Toyota Repair Estimate to fix the rusting, failing frame and make it safe again is  $17,783.71 which is half the value of a brand new vehicle!!!!! Toyota Corporate said, sorry, we have recalled many other rusting frames on our other models because they should not have rusted they way that have, but unfortunately for you, we will not stand behind your 4Runner that you paid $34,000 for. I am told that it is the same frame as some of the other recalled models. The Toyota Corporation tried to comfort me by ensuring me that they logged my case will contact me via First Class mail if they ever do decide to stand behind their product and make good on my $18,000 pile of useless rust.',\n",

First of all, I have spend some much money on repairs with this vehicle and precious time in and out of the shop. At less than 10,000 miles, it started having transmission problems. The car was in and out of the shop, with us having to pay out of pocket multiple times and countless hours spent with consumer affairs and the dealer before the CVT was finally recalled and the problem was fixed. Before then, no one would accept the problem eventhough it was well documented by the dealers that this was happening time and time again. The frustrating part is no one will be accountable; instead it is denied and there is no support for customers until lawsuits are filed. Now, only a year after the transmission issue was finally resolved, a shifter problem. The truck will not shift out of park at times. At first, it happened randomly but now it’s all the time. The dealer shop personnel cannot say how this is damaged but agree (“off the record”) that this is a manufacturing problem and that they are seeing this with many of the vehicles. However, because an official recall has not been filed for this year Nissan,  there is nothing they can do. We had to pay $1,000 out of pocket to have this fixed. No support from the dealer or from Nissan customer affairs. They will not accept responsibility. These are only two of the biggest problems.

The car has only 53,146 miles and no other mechanical problems. I found out Nissan extended warranties on 2007-2010 select vehicles including the Maxima due to CVT transmission problems. My car was towed to Nissan early Monday morning. I was given a toll free number to corporate office for possible assistance on Tuesday and they kept my car through Friday before coming back to tell me they would not be assisting me. I asked what criteria was used to make that determination. The agent stated the same info I had given them on Tuesday morning, i.e., how many miles are on the vehicle, the warranty, etc. They had no intention of assisting. What a waste! It is all about the dollar. The car is cosmetic, just looks good, that's it! She said it was 15 months outside of warranty when in fact I bought an extended 6 year/100000 mile warranty from Nissan when I bought the car. The warranty expired 3 months ago in November 2016. They stated they did not see the warranty in their system and it must have been an outside warranty sold to me by Nissan. All CVT transmission cars should be recalled. It is like a ticking time bomb. They are waiting for something drastic to happen before being forced to recall. What a waste!\",\n",

After retiring from real estate I didn't need a large SUV, so I wanted something smaller. I found a nice looking 2003 Toyota Rav4 that seemed to fit my bill. It ran good, the interior was nice and it seemed like it would do me well. I should have read some of the one star reviews. If I had, I would have seen that this vehicle had a bad engine in it and that Toyota doesn't seem to care. The engine has a design defect that caused the head bolts in the back of the engine to pull up and strip the threads in the engine block. Fixing the problem means replacing the engine at a cost of at least $3000. I live on a fixed income now and I don't have that kind of money laying around. I can't drive the car any more than 100 miles without stopping, letting it cool down and putting some water in it. So basically, I'm stuck near home. I wouldn't dream of taking this car on the road. The problem with replacing the engine is that the shop will just put a used engine in the car. Not a rebuilt one. Just a used one. Which will most likely have the same problem this one has. This is the second time I've owned a Toyota and the second time I've gotten a dodgy engine. This will be the last time I have to deal with Toyota and their engines, because I will not buy another. I'll get a Honda CRV or Nissan Rouge. No more Toyotas.\",\n",

This is my sixth Nissan/Infiniti up till now every vehicle has been bullet proof.  Have to say every single issue being reported about this vehicle seems to be absolutely true.  Transmission abrupt shifting, diesel odor in cabin, clunking noise in front end, power cut off when turning, and electronic issues!!  Transmission shifting hard up and down.  On the way home from the dealership in TN headed to OH the vehicle was barely drivable.  It shifted so hard down that I was seriously concerned it would damage itself so I had to drive it at constant speed making trip intense to say the least.  Note this was after the TN dealership supposedly completed the \"transmission update\".  I limped vehicle into dealership in Dayton OH.  Dayton Nissan dealer completed transmission update and advised vehicle good to go.  Picked up vehicle and drove it off lot...first lot clunk!  All day long...downshift clunk!...upshift pop!.  Oh man now I\\'m really getting concerned.  I\\'m so concerned about transmission damaging itself that I\\'m overlooking the other problems.  But lets talk about those.  My next main concern is the loss of power when turning.  You turn and hit the gas to accelerate and there is nothing there!!  I\\'m not talking turbo lag I\\'m talking literally the power goes to zero!  Then equally bad when after it goes to zero it lags big time then abruptly comes on.  I\\'ve been trying different driving habits to see if it does this in straight aways or if it is strictly on turns.  It is most definitely more pronounced when turning.  Talk about dangerous!!  Just today pulled out at major intersection and gas truck coming towards light in first lane...pull out quarter way when I realize man this guy can\\'t stop.  Turning left.  Hit gas to get away as smoke is billowing out from under his truck and nothing!!  Thank Jesus as the truck was going to smack me broadside power kicked on and I escaped major incident if not death.  Wow!!  Had I been driving my BMW X5 diesel under same circumstances it would have jetted me away so quick I wouldn\\'t have even thought about it later in the day.  This thing is a potential death trap!  Ok so enough drama.  The odor enters the cabin while idling, driving slow, and occasional a waft or two while tooling down the highway.  My friend the other day while idling was like \"dude seriously this thing is making me nauseous\".  I\\'m like well you get used to it after awhile.  He was like hurry up and get me to our destination I don\\'t know how you are driving this like this.  Electronics are full of gremlins on this baby.  Get in fire her up and on comes the screen stating tran data is being transmitted...shift into R and camera should kick on ...would be nice...but instead screen doesn\\'t change!  Good thing I didn\\'t back up because a kid was standing behind my truck and well...hmm...accident!!  Are you kidding me?!!  What good is a back up camera on a vehicle if it isn\\'t reliable?!  It is more unsafe might as well disconnect it!!!  Ok so lets talk about more issues that are nuisance but not going to cause bodily injury or death.  Back up and get to bottom of drive and springs in front compress as wheel is turned and squeak squeal creak groan.  Is this a new Nissan Titan XD Premium or a 1952 Ford?  I would argue the 52 Ford pickup wouldn\\'t make these many noises when simply backing up!  Embarrassing to say the least.  I could keep going but I\\'m tired now of hating this vehicle already.  I\\'ve owned probably 75 different vehicles mostly new and never anything remotely like this beast.  Right now it is a beast of burden.  Going back into the shop next week I\\'ll keep you posted.  Expectations very low at this point based on the fact Car and Driver just rated Nissan Titan XD they have at 30K and it most definitely is a lemon!!',\n",

Was on a trip in Canada when I had a flat and had no idea which would be the closest city. Battery drains in a heart beat if you open and close the back hatch several times while packing for a trip. Need a big truck to give you a jump. Had to replace battery twice within the first 5 years. The plastic components like inside driver door handle and steering wheel spokes are crap. The have a thin colored plastic coating on it that bubbles up and peels off. Was told it is the acid in my skin - first car ever that was allergic to me! On 05Aug15 I had the routine maintenance done. The warranty ran out 18Aug15, but I only had 86937 miles on the car. On 20Aug15 I break down on the side of the road with a trunk full of perishable groceries. Had to have it towed to dealership 50 miles away. Electronic water pump and thermostat needed to be replaced $1950. Picked up the car the next week and on the drive home the A/C went out. They picked up the car the next day, and it needed a new compressor at $3,000. Received the car two days later and now the passenger side electric mirror control is messed up. Run, honey, run!',\n",

I took it to the dealer and they stated there is a design flaw in all Camrys in that they burn oil at a rate of 2 qts per 3000 miles. If you check your oil between changes you will discover this for yourself. It was in the dealership for 3 months and is still not running properly. Please take this advice and don't listen to the Toyota dealers. There is a serious design flaw in all Camrys. They are counting on you not checking the oil in between regular oil changes and before you realize it, blown engine. I was a big fan of the Toyota lines but now will not even consider buying one. I am not disgruntled by this experience , I just want to save others the headache of going thorough what I did. There are better choices out there.

              " {'sequence': \" I've been a member of the BMWCCA for more than ten years now. This is my 7th three series. M package, rear wheel drive manual 6speed, Power Kit so 320 HP.Noticed and felt engine noise since 68k miles. thought it might be the flywheel and clutch. Replaced at $3,000. Not the issueDealership did a compression test, said it needs a new engine. $18,000! BMW will cover 50% because it's out of warranty. I provided all oil change docs. BMW wanted to see oil changes at least every 15k. I averaged every 7,500 miles. Never auto crossed or tracked. Commuter car, 42 year old father of four. Not laying down patches or beating on the car.My take, don't buy a turbo model. Too much stress on the engine components. Never own one of these out of warranty, you're asking for trouble. Fuel pump was replaced under warranty (common issue), water pump was on  my dime. Hardly reliable, worst car I've ever owned. Beast on the highway? at 4.3 0-60 yes. Sad to say it, I'm a Bimmer guy through and through but that's it for me. BMW corporate said they wouldn't make a repair coverage decision until they knew for sure what the problem was. I wanted the dealership to drop the oil pan to definitively diagnose the issue  so I could tell BMW NA what was wrong. After the compression test all of a sudden the dealership clammed up like it was a cover up? The dealership would not go any further. They told the manufacturer that it needed a new engine without ever dropping the oil pan and taking a peek. Didn't make sense. I still want to have an independent garage take a look so maybe I can get some video or pics and post them. Forget about BMW customer service. I got someone on the line outsourced from India. If you must buy a BMW again never own one out of warranty! Unless your buying a fixer upper for a couple of grand. I traded it in on a new Silverado burying the negative equity of the Bimmer into the truck payment. Tough pill to swollow Good luck!\",\n",

Few weeks after that same issue so I took it in again and they said oh it's the Mass Air Flow Sensor. Well a month after that same problem, take it in again and they say oh it's only an Oxygen Sensor I believe they said and replaced it. Well guess what? Month later I am driving with my wife and 2 young children ages 11 & 6 on a very busy 4 lane highway suddenly same exact issue car will not accelerate above 35 MPH and then stalls out in the middle of the highway causing my family to literally miss getting rear ended by a Semi by maybe a foot, again I was nearly certain it's the Transmission have it towed there and again they say no, this time it's the Throttle Body. I have wrote corporate, my local dealer ship and all they keep saying is the Warranty is now up, however, if the problem persist the will cover it. I am literally petrified to put my family back in this 🍋 lemon and now it literally sits in my driveway reminding of what a poor brand is. Bought the vehicle brand new and for 2 years it's been in the shop half a dozen times or more for the same issue that they keep saying is something else when I am certain it is the transmission, so I am stuck with a lemon and the payments on a lemon that myself nor my wife are comfortable driving for fear of the next close call with a semi becoming reality thanks Nissan for refusing to admit it's the Transmission and replacing every part in the car but the transmission.\",\n",

I bought a Vermelain Red Black interior 2012.  Loved the car at the time.  Paid big bucks, everything at BMW is a “package”.  I like to keep my cars – not this one.  I had it about a month and it had a chassis malfunction. No one could figure out what that was and the problem came and went.  Then there was an indicator for “increased battery discharge”.  The dealer changed cables etc., I brought it in about 4 times then demanded a new battery which I got.  Then the indicator said “high battery drain”.  Fed up at this point I waited until the car had to go in for the next service.  When I brought it in they wouldn’t release the car back.  The keyless system was somehow communicating with the battery and the car was ready to go on fire.  Around the same time about 5,000 miles the car is asking for oil.  They said that’s all normal wait until it hits 15,000 miles.  15,000 miles came and went the car needed a quart of oil every 5000 miles.  The need for oil then started to increase as the mileage continued to increase.  Eventually, every 900 miles the car needed oil.  BMW insisted that was all normal.  I wrote to Germany (in German) they referred the problem to BMW North America.  They sent a service technician to look at the vehicle – said it was all normal.  I was the one topping off the oil not BMW.  Then they told me they wanted me to go to the dealer every time it needed oil.  Really! – I drive over a 100 miles a day.  The dealer is about 2 hours away round trip.  I would waste 2 hours every 2 weeks on oil!  Beyond that, BMW did nothing.  At approximately 50,000 miles it didn’t seem to have the drive or acceleration intensity that is used to have; it couldn’t get out of it’s own way.  The dealer said it was normal.  The next visit for service not long after the complaint of lack of acceleration – eureka it’s leaking oil and the turbos need rebuilding (which was another 6 weeks at the dealer).  That was fixed I drive into my driveway to see the “oil” light go on again – back to the dealer I go.  After all that the car did regain its acceleration that it should have.  Now 5 years later I am still putting a quart of oil in the car every 900 miles.  It needs brakes (normal maintenance), turbos either need to be rebuilt or replaced, and the I Drive is playing games.  You put it on one thing and it changes itself to another.  Using an independent mechanic certified in BMW who doesn’t charge like a dealer the cost of this vehicle to keep for 1 year has been $10,000.  After paying $90,000 for a vehicle you would expect a lot more from the car, the dealer and BMW – you get nothing from any of them.  Now do you want to do that – me either it’s traded never to be purchased again!',\n",

The equipment failure caused me to be stranded on the highway, forcing me to have my car towed to the nearest auto repair shop, costing me $2,220 in repairs. My vehicle only had 72,720 miles when the malfunction occurred. In reaching out to I-90 Nissan in Sheffield Ohio, which is where I purchased my vehicle, the staff was friendly but deferred me to Nissan Corporate to file a claim with Consumer Affairs. Consumer Affairs denied my claim because I did not take my vehicle to an “authorized dealer”. While stranded on the highway, the last place I was thinking about taking me vehicle was to the dealer (15+ miles away) that sold me a car that had a major equipment failure in less than 5 years of owning it. The broken control arm was completely rusted out, with an unsealed hole at the top, allowing water and salt to pour in. The other control arm was rusted, with stress fractures and was on its way to break soon. Lesley at Nissan Corporate told me she stands by the quality of Nissan vehicles. If control arms rusting out, breaking and causing people to lose control of their vehicle is considered quality, then I ENCOURAGE ANYONE LOOKING TO PURCHASE A NISSAN TO USE CAUTION!Also, the hood of my trunk has rust issues, which was “fixed” years ago. The same rusted out areas are back. I also have \"rail dust\" all over my vehicle. It seems Nissan has an issue with their vehicles and parts rusting out early.',\n",

However, acceleration and highway driving in any hills or mountains is a loser.   A lot of engine noise with any acceleration.  RPM = Noise in this car.  Very slow getting going from a stop, for the first 100 feet, then the engine spools up, making a lot of noise, but not a lot of acceleration.  Driving at 60 with cruise control on, the car will go faster down hill to about 65, then the CVT \"downshifts\" the car and the engine revs to 4,500 rpm to slow it down; however it really doesn\\'t do much but make a lot of noise.  The driver gives over control of the car to the lousy transmission.  There is only D, S and B.  The owner\\'s manual said nothing about these positions.  Moving to S, is adds RPM and some slowing.  moving to B makes a lot more RPM and more slowing.  There is no way to have any other control over this transmission than just those positions.   With a real 6 speed manual or automatic transmission, this would be a much better economy car.  I\\'ve owned five cars with less HP and better acceleration due to 5 speed manual transmissions that did not slip and slide like the CT.  The CVT makes it a DUD.  One additional thing that I found to be troubling was rear window visibility.  With fixed headrests on both sides of the vehicle, and an adjustable one in the center, it restricted visibility when making a quick lane change.  The headrests are only needed with rear passengers.  I ended up lowering the back rest on the passenger side to remove the visual obstruction of the right and center headrests, meaning we drove around with the trunk open to the interior.

I\\'d been to the dealer a total of three times to fix the other noises and a \"catch\" in the moonroof cover to no avail.

The other thing you should know about is the Info- tainment system. Toyota Entune system is a joke and all Nav head unit functions are slow and clunky especially when compared to other auto makes from the same era.

Better off to take the money to Vegas for a crapshot at the tables.My theory is the belt is generating so much heat, that componts fail. After all, why are they offering an oil cooler for the cvt transmission? For my 2014 Nissan Rouge ,the dealer wants $3000.00 to repair and a wait for parts. $ 1700.00 for an oil cooler? Its a scam for Nissan. The 100,000 mile extended warrenty for cvt nissan transmission,well,the dealer run my vin# and said its not covered!  I say the Us goverment should make Nissan buy their defect product back at full price.  June 15. 2018- Well.quess what. The car would not start at the store. Cranks but no start.  Tow to shop and plug it in,no codes,that afternoon it started! I dare not to use it. So I have two issues,cvt transmission and a no start. I hope it burns down soon.  Update: July 18,2018  Finally borrowed the money for cvt transmissiom repairs. Oh yeah, the dealer want payment in full with open repair bill! Meaning any and all additional parts and labor could be added on later date. Put the nissan rouge car in the shop on July 05,2018 and dealer  said they should be getting the parts-valve body and oil cooler by the 25 of July, then work will begin. Asked for the old worn out parts to be given back to me. The dealer said their will be a core charge on them. So they are rebuilting old parts and selling them back to you. I will kept the updates coming. July 18,2018, we got the car out of the shop. Drove home 120 miles,park car, next morning it would not start. Ended up purchasing a new battery, replacing the orignal battery. Started up fine then that afternoon, it would not start when hot, a no start again. There is a code , but we have to drive 125 miles one way to Nissan shop to hook up to their computer,which is $ 117.00 charge. And with this hot weather , we dare not. We do not want to cook outside in 100 degrees heat if we broke down again. Its due brakes shoes and fan belt too. If this is what techknowledge is all about,  count me out!  August 02.  2018 , The Nissan dealer repaired the cvt  transmission stated their work was warrented for only 12,000 miles....great, isn,t it.  Update;  August 10,  2018 car quit running. Dealer wants $ 800.00 to fix.  As I stated. I am on retirement with limited resources and 65+ years old.   Our selves, we firquied it was the fuel pump,  by unhooking the air cleaner and squired a little gasoline down the air cleaner manflod. It started til it burned what little gas we had squired down line.  So called the wrecking yard and found another Nissan rouge select. Brought the fuel pump for $ 75.00.  The fuel pump was located under the second bench seat.Grab the front end of the 2 nd bench seat and give it a quick yank upwards to free it.  Now getting the fuel pump retaining ring off was very hard. Turns out they make a tool # J-455747, its on E Bay for $18.00,buy it.  Fixed and done,far more peppy too. Hopes this helps someone out there. Thanks.  August  18,  2018  Disclaimer;  do not take replacing the fuel pump job lightly. Raw gasoline inside the tank exposed, heat, spark or static electricity  ( cell  phones  ) could set off an explosion. I wear Nomax fire retarded coveralls,had a 20 pound fire extinguish, ground wire from car frame to dirt ground, doing the repairs outside in event of fire,wouldn't want to burn your house down,  and a heavy blanket to thrown over the top gas tank hole. I have 26 years working around crude oil so.  think hard about repairing first, safely starts first. Up date; blue book value says car wroth id $ 5,000.00 - $ 6,000.00  now. August 30,2018. Sad, isn,t it.\",\n",

Please look and consider all models til your feet fall off before you sign any papers!UPDATE:  I've had the Altima for 1 1/2 yrs now.  Hwy mileage is great! Driving in town I only get about 16 miles per gal. It says its getting more and it tracks how many miles are left before empty, but by the time I drive six miles it uses twice the amount of gas than it says it has left.

The Select is the first generation Rogue that Nissan continued to produce alongside the 2nd generation for 2 years, so basically this review is about the 1st generation Rogue. The AWD system is great and I never felt like I was losing or about to lose traction. The acceleration is horrible. You have to keep it at 3,000 RPM or more for any decent acceleration and the engine complains the entire time. There's a lot of noise in the cabin, so much that it's hard to carry on a conversation whilst merging onto the freeway. When accelerating at low speeds, the CVT keeps the engine around 1,250-1,500 RPM and it feels like the engine is lugging and on the verge of stalling. It's noisy over bumps in the road and the gas mileage is horrible. The driver's seat could use more lumbar support. The stereo sounds great which is the only positive about the car.

After it does you correct but small corrections do nothing and larger ones over compensate so you need to correct again. This is constant and driving takes a ton of concentration as you\\'re always fixing the direction of the car.

Also noticed that my MPG was awful, getting around 13 mpg for a 18.5 gallon tank. So next I try the 2 Oxygen sensors upstream and downstream ($150) and still nothing, so I'm now thinking this tacoma truck is indeed a [non-permissible content removed] So I take the piece of garbage to the Toyota dealership and they keep the truck for 8 hours on a Saturday !!!!! and tell me truck has the wrong spark plugs and that's causing the PO171 code. $258 later they replace the spark plugs and clear the code and off I go. 8 miles down the road I noticed the piece of crap is misfiring out the tailpipe and CEL comes back on? So after a few more curse words I decide to take it back to dealership the next day and complain. After keeping the garbage truck for 5 hours they now tell me it could be the timing belt was off by a tooth and maybe the fuel injector needs to be replace.....$2,200.00 !!!! Are you fricking kidding me. ROFLMAO. So I take the truck home and the next day when I started, a huge black smoke comes out of tailpipe. Ugh. So I go get timing belt done on my own with a local mechanic and the cost was $500.00 with parts. Drive 4 miles down the road and CEL comes back on ? [non-permissible content removed] So now I replace the Fuel filter and still CEL on. After doing some research I find out that Toyota brand only likes DENSO sensors so I again replaced the 2 Oxygen sensors with DENSO and boom CEL goes off. So I actually drove 250 with NO CEL on but she kept misfiring out the tailpipe and hesitation. So I go and replace the fuel pump and still same issue. And then go after the gaskets and seals and replace them.Now I'm getting ready to dump this piece of garbage out to sea. So a few days later I noticed a funny gas smell coming from  the inside of the engine. What is up, now I have a leaking fuel injector ?? Another $450 to fix. And yep CEL comes back on and this time it's the bad sensor may set a P0401 code (insufficient EGR flow), or it may not set an EGR code but a P0171 and/or P0174 lean code instead. I'm going nuts !!!!! Fix the Fuel injector, reset the computer by disconnecting the battery. So Good riddance you [non-permissible conten removed] tacoma. Toyota got it wrong. DO NOT by a first generation Tacoma at all. Stay away !!!!!! Far away. The worst truck I have bought in my entire life and would not recommend a first generation Tacoma to anyone. GRADE F\",\n",

              " {'sequence': ' I have been a Toyota owner for the last five years. My family has owned multiple Toyota cars in the past years, hence, the reason why my family decided to purchase a Toyota vehicle. Since the ownership of my Toyota Corolla, which was bought brand new, I have had multiple issues with the vehicle, i.e., temperature gauge had gone bad two-years after purchasing the vehicle, driver\\'s window stuck in down position, and the vehicle began to shake vigorously at around 40,000 miles and then again at 78,000 miles (when my children under the age of 5 were present during both incidents). I have been getting the vehicle serviced and maintained on time from a Toyota authorized service dealership. I have been completely unsatisfied with the level of care and commitment Toyota has provided. For a company that strives on \"innovation, quality and reliability,\" Toyota has failedto comply with their standards and level of concern. I had registered a complaint with the Toyota Customer Experience Center, who disregard my complaint and faulted me atthe vehicle’s condition. The Executives that I had dealt with repeatedly continued to say that the engine failing is not Toyota\\'s problem, even though I am able to prove that my maintenance was done on a timely basis. The Customer Care team members are rude and beyond help, with no sense of professionalism or mannerism. I have an $8,000.00 expense at the cost of Toyota’s faults and oversight. I am appalled to learn that Toyota knew about such faulty engines and issues but chose not take any action to fix such vehicles, given the fact they claim they have the most reliable cars – I think that is an understatement. Now, I will think twice before going back to a Toyota and never recommend anyone to purchase a vehicle from Toyota until they are able to accept responsibly and value their vehicles and customers.',\n",

              " {'sequence': ' Many of us believe that TOYOTA is a best brand and it will run atleast for 100000 miles. I also felt the same and bought the car from a dealer earlier in 2013, a 2010 Toyota Camry. Now the miles is around 84000. I used to do my oil checks, vehicle check properly. Last month also i did there were no issues reported. All of the sudden this sunday the engine started to make noise. No rains, no animals no accident it started to behave on its own. The Check engine light and VSC light started to glow, i am shocked to see this happening. I went to TOYOTA Dealer they said this is a serious problem. A car having trouble in engine within 84000 miles I was also crazy to hear it.I called the Toyota motors they simply state the engine is out of warranty and they cannot help on this as they provided only the warranty for 5 Years or 60000 Miles. Even though I explained the situation they are not ready to listen anymore and they simply declined the request. With no other options left i have to go back to my Toyota Dealer again now he told about 6000$ after an hour talk he reduced to 4000$. The part is coming only around 1000$ but the service charge they are asking for 3000$. The problem is with the ignition coil and when i read it in the websites there are chances that the car could have been gone uncontrol and its a risk factor for anyone to drive.Toyota is not ready to accept this as its fault. I believe they need to value the customers and their safety. They feel after 60000 miles whatever happen to the owner they wont care. Its a bad attitude.   The review remains same.. I paid the money(4000) that I have been asked to get the car out from service shop. I stopped going to the showroom in which the service was done. Three months Later I got a compliant there is a leak in engine when I did service in another Toyota show room, I went to the dealer again who fixed my engine(ignition coil). He refused and said it is nothing to do with the service they made and said it would cost another 1000$ for fixing it. “It is worthless to spend more money on the CAMRY.”',\n",

My one year old vehicle wouldn't even pass inspection.  The tire tread wear was uneven.  The dealer said it was initially alignment issues, which was not the case.  Bridgestone pro-rated the tires and helped me with the replacement cost, while Toyota did nothing.  Bridgestone indicated that this is a manufacturing problem based on how the tires are wearing down.   Additionally, they indicated that this is a big problem on the Sienna only.  They have helped customers with pro rating tires, but Toyota is not helping.  It's a family vehicle and to have a problem like this boils down to $$ and safety.  The fact that Toyota has done nothing to fix this problem is a red flag for me.  Each tire is about $260 to replace and to only get 15,000 miles out of the first set is a problem.  At this rate, I will put 4 sets of tires on the van by the time my lease is up after only 3 years.\",\n",

I guess I can say I was lucky because I didn't have any problems until it reached about 100K miles. Once it hit that milestone, it started having all the same problems that everyone else has been saying. Fuel sensor unit, check engine light going on, tire sensors going on, 2 valve jobs, coolant sending issue, etc. During a drive across town one day in June of 2015 and with only 122K miles on it, I felt a knock underneath the vehicle. Shortly afterward, it wouldn't engage in reverse and then quit engaging in forward after that before it completely crapped out and stranded me in the hood. I knew from reading all these forums what it was. You are right; it was the transmission. 2 months, 2 stints in the repair shop during those 2 months, other repairs needed, and a new transmission, it was finally back on the road $3200 later. Nissan wouldn't do anything and the dealership told me not to waste my time. Like a girl who has cheated on you many times, I couldn't trust it. Needless to say, it was on Craigslist the moment it was out of the shop. I did get rid of it and bought a Toyota SUV. No more Nissans from now on. Would have been a different story if Nissan would have taken responsibility and owned up to this problem and issues. Just from reading these forums, it looks like I am not the only one who will never buy another Nissan again.\",\n",

Unfortunately, my little dream car turned into a nightmare a mere 3 weeks after purchase. While stopped at a red light, an error message popped up on the dash saying \"Charging System Malfunction\" and I thought it was just an issue with my GPS, which was plugged into the outlet. I unplugged it and then another message popped up, this time saying \"Oil pressure low\" followed by messages saying to consult my owners manual and to take the car in for service. I was at an intersection and tried to turn onto the side road, only to find I had no accelerator power. I was slamming on the gas trying to move, and I was only able to do so because I was going downhill. Two good samaritans helped push me to safety, but to my horror I had NO brakes while the car was in neutral. I had to shift the car into park and lurch to a stop. One of the guys who helped suggested turning off and restarting the car, and sure enough the error messages went away. Still, I had it towed to the dealership, after dealing with Toyota Care and waiting 2 hours for the tow truck to get there. To condense this novel, the car threw no error codes when service checked it, and they\\'re maintaining that nothing is wrong with the car. I\\'ve had to open a case with Toyota and I honestly can\\'t believe what a horrible experience the whole thing has been. More effort has been put into attacking my credibility and denying what happened than it has in actually fixing what\\'s obviously a major issue. For a brand new car to malfunction and impede my ability to control it is unacceptable, and I will not be driving it again. I really hope I was just sold a lemon and that no other owners experience these issues, but I will NEVER buy a Toyota again. They do not stand behind their products, and I highly recommend taking your business to a manufacturer that does.',\n",

In less than three years and just over 36,000 miles we have serviced the transmission 3-4 times (I\\'ve lost count), had it brought in for brake noise (screeching) at least 4 times, and just this week the bearings in both rear wheels had to be replaced. The brakes still squeal but they won\\'t do anything about it because it isn\\'t \"that bad.\" They reconditioned the surface of the rotors, re-shimmed the pads and replaced the pads 9 months ago.  I warned them then that I knew this was only a temporary fix and that I was concerned that they would get noisy again once the warranty expires and that is exactly what has happened. A few months before that they shimmed the pads which made it better temporarily. The disk brakes on every other car I\\'ve owned have not been anywhere close to this noisy! Unless I change the pads and turn the rotors to sell it it will easily affect the value of the car and then I am only passing this problem along to the next owner.The tranny has the shakes. It has been reprogrammed, the alternator was replaced because supposedly the voltage was affecting the timing of the tranny, and most recently a vale body was replaced. The oscillation problem is better for now but my wife had it buck again last week just not as bad. Now we have a vibration at about 72-73 MPH that is reportedly \"engine harmonics\" that resonates through the body of the vehicle. None of my other cars (including the Fiat) have ever had \"engine harmonics\" ring throughout the car. Their claim that this is acceptable is ridiculous. Their competitors do not have this problem.I am highly concerned that I have more bearing issues in the future. Being the Director of Operations for a manufacturer I know what a rogue lot is.We bought this car because of it and Nissan\\'s reputation as being a good product and company which may be true, but that hasn\\'t been our experience. IF YOU DO HAVE PROBLEMS expect nothing but pushback from Nissan.Update: 7/3/16 sold the Nissan Altman, bought a Honda Accord, problem solved.A year later and we have no such problems and no \"engine harmonics\" with the Honda and it also has a CVT.',\n",

              " {'sequence': \" I bought my Rogue Sport at the end of August and by the end of October is started having problems with the Forward Emergency Braking.  While driving on multiple occasions, the car would apply the brakes for no reason and without a car anywhere around me.  I took my car into service dept. at Downtown Nissan in Nashville where they could not find a problem.  I started a case with Nissan USA and they did testing and sent out an inspector and still found nothing. I took the car back home after them having it 58 days because Nissan USA could not find the problem.  Beware, Nissan does not care about their customers!!  If they did, they would not of put me back on the road in my UNSAFE CAR. Now, I have a crashing of 2 cars symbol flashing on my dash at intermittent time but again Nissan can not find anything wrong with it. Once again, they can not duplicate the problem so as far as they are concerned there is no problem.  Guess what?  I have multiple videos of this happening while driving but that is not good enough for them.  It is not my problem that they can't find the problem.  By the way, I am aware of someone else in Alabama with the exact same problem.  Please do yourself a favor and purchase other than the Rogue Sport or you might just have the same problem.  Remember, if you do purchase and have problems, chances are Nissan USA will not help you either.\",\n",

Last weekend I drove to Kansas from Colorado and back in a day, and it was killing me. After driving the car for 5 hours and a little over 400 miles I was limping at the gas station. 300 miles later I got out to walk around and was limping from the pain of my foot the entire time. I switched out with the co-driver and she said after just driving for an hour her leg and thigh was killing her. The foot peddle is small and really hard to keep at the right speed, there is no cruse control and the speed gauge goes in increments of 10 so you don't know how fast you are going. Having to keep looking at the speed gauge every 10 seconds to see that you are speeding or not makes this unsafe because YOU ARE NOT WATCHING THE ROAD! which makes this an unsafe car to drive even in the city. When we finally got back to Colorado I could barley walk to the front door of our house and 3 days later my foot still hurts.\",\n",

However, I was told by the dealership that the transmission is now leaking.  I am still VERY disappointed with the parts that have been replaced on the van by a Toyota dealership not lasting like I feel they should.  Seems I am only getting 1/2 life on the replaced Toyota parts such as the rack-n-pinion, shocks, struts, and axles.  The original parts lasted me over 215,000 miles, and these genuine Toyota replacement parts haven't even lasted 90,000 miles.  A big disappointment.I've owned my Sienna since it was new.I now have over 300,000 miles on my van.It has given me little problem over the years, but now seems to be falling apart.  It's been one thing after another.  This includes the interior and exterior parts.  So it would appear that the interior's life expectancy is about 10 years when the plastic parts start cracking and breaking, and when the electrical starts to give problems.  The tires still wear unevenly and need replacing at about 1/2 life even with regular alignments & tire rotations.I've been happy with the van until it hit the 10 year mark and about 280,000 miles.  Was hoping to get 400,000 miles on the van before letting her go.  But she won't make it that far.\",\n",

There are about 20 engine components that were essentially recalled. Depending on when, or if, your 550i went through this program will determine the number of components you may have had replaced. Initially, BMW changed out these components, one at a time and each time you had a check engine light come on the would replace the next most commonly malfunctioning part. Eventually, they started flat out replacing all the components since they would eventually fail (I believe due to the heat and pressure they are placed under with the twin turbo.  This added up to owners paying for their vehicle while they spent months in the shop. While BMW did cover the costs of the replacement and extend the warranty, having engine issue undoubtedly will lead to transmission issues. This was the case of the most recent 550i owner I met at an German auto shop while getting another vehicle pre purchase inspected. He said he spend over 10k on transmission work and eventual replacement while he owned the vehicle for only 6 months, 2 of those months was spent in the shop. These repair costs were not covered by BMW.   Some sleazy owners, will not mention this program/issue at all to you when selling the car (which was what happened in my case). Luckily the deal fell through in the 11th hour at the bank when the vehicle failed state inspection (due to worn out tires and brakes in this case). Owner claimed that both tires and brakes were replaced within the last 6 months. Some owners and used car salesmen are doing whatever they can to u load these problematic vehicles. Buyer beware!!!\",\n",

The truck was missing paint ( just paint over primer on the passenger side cab, and front and rear doors.) Within the drip panels on top of the truck they missed caulking half the drip panels. And Sloppily caulked the rest They then just painted over caulk. In the bed they didn’t caulk one of the seams in the interior of the bed and you could see daylight down to the floor. . Brought the truck to 3 dealers two of which wouldn’t even make a warranty claim saying that’s just how they build them. Nissan Consumer affairs has switched the regional manager on me 3 times now from Stefanie to Jennifer now to Debbie. They don’t take phone calls and won’t leave email addresses so I can have receipt of contact with them. I went a different dealer other than the one I bought the truck at and they literally laughed out loud when looking over my truck. They made a warranty claim for over $12,000 in body work the truck needed. It is junk just junk. DO NOT BUY ! The truck has can’t be fixed right to factory spec, The only thing worse than the piece of junk truck is their customer service they refused to even send an engineer out to look at the truck I wish I could put up pictures so you can see this junk. Nissans dealer network is a joke. I am left with the decision to let them attempt to fix the truck, and have it look even worse cause even their own Dealers said they could never replicate a factory paint job, or leave it the way it is. Wither way I am left with  truck that has about $7,000 in diminished value given the amount of body work it needs, or the same  amount of repairs that will be visible to an appraisers eye when I go to trade it in.

At 2000 miles the transmission did the shutter thing and the transmission was replaced by Michael Jordan service department. Case #15450446 was opened up by Nissan Corporation (useless individuals). I wanted my $32,000 back or a brand new Pathfinder. Corporation would not budge one bit other than upping my warranty on the transmission to 100,000 miles. Still was extremely mad because who wants a brand new car with transmission taken out already at 2000 miles. No way I could sell it! Well guess what, at 18000 miles that transmission went out and this time my wife barely made it to Michael Jordan Nissan without it breaking (making all kinds of noise) down on her. Still corporation would not budge one bit! Service department replaced transmission again and wife was always scared to drive it far on a trip because she was afraid it would break down on her. Well guess what, at 46000 miles that transmission is in Michael Jordan service department right now getting replaced. I’ll be on my 4th transmission at only 46000 miles on car. Case# 20757949 is now opened up and I’m waiting on a response back from them. They better give me my money back or a brand new 2016 Pathfinder.

Here we are four years and 30,000 miles later selling it for $500 due to a transmission issues that comes and goes, and since the problem comes and goes our mechanic is unable to diagnose the problem.  In the past four years we have had to repair or replace wheel bearings, the ABS sensor, front control arm, 3 ignition coils, spark plugs, and a brake caliper.  Right now the car needs a catalytic converter and an engine mount, but since we are done throwing money at this lemon I am not having those repaired and will be very upfront about the cars issues to whomever takes it off our hands.  The transmission has been acting up on and off for over two years, it is a very odd problem where it acts like it is slipping, and then a day or two later is 100% fine.  Since it is so intermittent there is little the mechanic can do.  Even he is frustrated with the car at this point, and he is making money off of it!Annoying things that we didn't try to repair to not waste even more money include the automatic sliding door being glitchy, sometimes it almost closes and then reopens, lots of fun in the rain or freezing winter weather.  However, if something is actually in the way of the sliding door (like me trying to put the baby in his seat) and it is closed by accident THEN it suddenly won't stop and does its best to squish you.  The console cracked early on.  The CD player doesn't work.  The handle covers for the rear seats cracked.  The vents fall out from the ceiling regularly.  There is some odd leak in the trunk that we were never able to pinpoint, so at this point we just make sure to not put anything in the back so that the water can evaporate and not get moldy.  It kills me because we really wanted to like this car.  It has plenty of room for us and our three kids and a haul from Costco.  If the grandparents want to come with us and the kids we can all fit in one car. But after dumping thousands in frequent and expensive repairs I just can't recommend this car to anyone.\",\n",

They have done nothing to mitigate or change the design of the problem leading to a 17hr service at $90 an hour.  The issue has not been addressed by Toyota because it is not a safety issue, thus they have seen no need to issue a recall.  Beyond the vehicle being huge on the outside, claustrophobic on the interior, the vehicle's seats are not very comfortable.  The fuel mileage is poor in relation to the engine performance.  Toyota's service dept. is also poor.  An oil change for the vehicle will take nearly 2 hours regardless of which dealership you visit.  The vehicle has poor off road performance mated with below average on road performance.  The doors do not open wide enough to accommodate loading a child into the vehicle.  The voice recognition system is not useful.  The seat warmers are wonderful.  The interior is well  appointed and of good build quality.  Visibility in the vehicle is poor.  The blind spots on the vehicle are large if you sit high in the vehicle.  The B and C pillars completely obstruct the view of the next lane.  The back up camera works well but is the only reliable way of backing the vehicle due to the high lip on the rear glass.  The vehicle bump and torque steers.

At 64,000 miles the CVT transmission failed. You will be driving on a freeway and the tachometer will start getting wacky. The rpm will jump from 1,000 to 3000 rpm and back. After sometime your transmission will seem to disengage and your rpm will drop to below 1,000 rpm. At that time you are dead! The car will slow down to a halt and even if you press your gas pedal, the engine will not increase rpm. It seems like the cvt transmission is telling the computer to prevent the car from running. I brought this to the dealer and they said they have several problems with Nissan cvt transmission and encouraged us to file our complaints to the Consumer Protection Bureau. I called Nissan and they passed me from one person to another and told me they can't help. They have no solution to the problem other than replace the CVT transmission for $3,000. I told them I never had any car before where I have to replace a transmission at 64,000 miles, 4,000 miles after their warranty expired. It is totally unfair. I reported this to the National Highway Traffic Safety Agency (NHTSA). If our government consumer protection agencies are doing half of their job, no one especially a big manufacturing company should be allowed to get away with this.[non-permissible content removed]\",\n",

They called me today saying it was fine now but are suggesting I replace the front and rear rotors and pads plus changing the brake fluid  that could cost up to  $1500, luckily the warranty covers it for now.

The day after picking it up I drove the vehicle and very excessive power train noise was present.

And, before I bought it, I insisted the seller take it to a BMW dealership and have it checked out. It cost me $100, and was found to have no issues at that time. Within the first six months, all the seals for the transfer case had to be replaced - $3,300. Within the next year, it started blowing white smoke from the exhaust, also common with this model. I took it in for an oil change and diagnosis for the white smoke. The repair shop found 3 small pieces from the oil pan and informed me that I needed a new oil pump, another common issue with the 4.4 engine - $3,000. Next, they informed me that, due to BMW using cheap valve guides which wore out prematurely causing the engine to burn oil, those had to be replaced. Another common issue with the 4.4 engine.  Cost - $7,000. My extended warranty provider refused to pay for repairs that totaled more than the value of the vehicle, so I ended up paying $4,000 out of pocket. After only six months since the rebuild, the engine is now leaking oil all over the driveway. Total cost paid by me and extended warranty = $22,000. My advice: Never buy a BMW  x5 with over 100,000 miles on it. I am now shopping for a 4Runner.',\n",

I know the dealership is gonna do the best they can to fix the car but I do not feel safe in that car anymore. This has happened twice, a Nissan truck and now a Nissan car. I don't think I can rely on the brand anymore. Ours might be an isolated case but hey Nissan, step up on checking the safety of your vehicles when they leave manufacturing.

Pros:  It does stop great for an SUV.  It is heavy and feels substantial.  I think it would be good in a wreck.  My suggestion: buy most any American made small SUV.  While not as nice and lacking the two bar emblem, they are more reliable and present less worries about what problems are going to surface when I crank up today.   Any Japanese small SUV is more reliable and better made.  These American and Japanese models also use the cheapest rot gut gas you can find and you simply hammer down to get from point a to b.

I'm wondering if I made the wrong decision in buying a model in its first year on the market... because it has been in the shop for 23 out of the 40 days since the day I brought it home. I have been a loyal customer to the Nissan Brand for many years. I never thought that I would be writing a review about how unhappy I am with my Nissan Armada. Its just painful when you make a purchase of this magnitude and spend your hard earned money for a product that turns out to be a NIGHTMARE. Im not sure how this story will end but its already taken a toll on me. If I had to do it all over again I would have waited another year before buying the Nissan Armada. I have to say its looks nice with all the bells and whistles. When you can't drive your new vehicle without issues all of that goes out the window. Well I will have to wait to see how this all plays out and do a follow up to this review after I get my vehicle back. So stay tuned for part 2 of my saga!!!\",\n",

The 4cyl are a lot different from the 6 cyl. They looks the same but they are not.I can reflect more problems but at this point i feel sorry for myself to buy this peace of bran new jub k..',\n",

Oil and engine had been maintained on schedule. I'm a 63 year old female - no hard driving was taking place in this car. The car was taken in for all standard service points. Was driving back from the airport and heard this sound - sounded like a rod or something - and drove it straight to the dealer.  Cost to repair - estimated at $6000 to  $7000 or so, before repairs were made.  I was not happy. After several conversions and an expression to the dealership about my lost faith in Toyota - I had hoped to own this car to over 200,000 miles or more - they eventually involved the factory.  In all fairness, the factory ended up picking up all but about $1500 or so, which I paid. My faith in Toyota has been shaken significantly - I guess in 2006 there was still the legacy of the previous management regime and their lost focus on reliability.   Beware.\",\n",

Had every fuel injector replaced at least once (a couple 2x) before hitting 45,000 miles.  The car was out of service so often that I got to drive a number of other BMW products from dealer, most of which were no where near as nice or had performance as good as my other vehicles (Jaguar XK, Chevy Tahoe Z71 4x4, Jeep GC Overland 4x4 diesel).  I bought the 6 cylinder BMW diesel based on a recommendation from a friend, in England (\"John\"), who told me that loved his (at the time).  However, several months after I bought my diesel, John told me that his 6 cylinder BMW diesel engine had blown up (literally!) while traveling about 50 milers from his home, and this just a few days after it had been \"serviced\" by the local BMW dealer.  His vehicle had just gone off warranty, and neither BMW nor the dealer would givr him any compensation or other assistance for the defective engine.

But it turns out this car is defective and made with a bad transmission. Because of this major defect, we have reason to believe there’s extremely poor quality control of the production process of this entire car if not other 2017 Camry’s. We weren’t given a chance to test drive the new car by our dealer. On our way back home on 11/18, we noticed that the car jerked forward abnormally every time when we pressed on the brake.  We took our car back to the dealer on 11/22 after try driving it multiple times at dealer’s recommendation. It took the dealer 4 hours to fix it. They adjusted the fluid level within the transmission according to the paperwork.  We haven’t had a chance driving the car again until 12/5 because of a flu in the family. On 12/5, the car won’t reverse and showed a warning message “Check Vehicle Stability Control System”. On 12/6/16, Toyota sent a toll truck and took our car back to the dealer’s service department. This time the service department replaced the defective new transmission with a re-manufactured (non-new) transmission.  In two weeks after we had this car, the car has gone through 2 repairs on transmission and included the replacement of transmission on a brand new car. We paid for a brand new Toyota Camry XLE, now 2 weeks later, the transmission is broken and replaced with a refurbished transmission. It might be a better choice to just buy a used car with much less price. This is a terrible new car experience for us and we have to warn other consumers about it. There should be something special about owning a new car. Toyota destroyed our experience by giving us a defective car and wants us to go through a lengthy process to get a refund or replacement. Stay away from 2017 Toyota Camry!!',\n",

              " {'sequence': ' We purchased a 2013 Rogue from a local dealer. It had less than 20,000 miles and was in excellent condition. The sales person remarked that it was like new and had \"Plenty of warranty coverage left\". For the first year of ownership the vehicle was great. Last summer when driving home form the beach it suddenly lost power on the interstate. Even with the gas pedal on the floor I could only go around 60 MPH. We pulled over and grabbed lunch and filled up. I thought maybe it was simply over heating. After lunch everything seemed normal so we continued our trip home. We had no further issues during the next 9 months. Earlier this summer I was driving home on the interstate and the same issue occurred. I was in the fast lane and suddenly lost power. Once again I pulled off the freeway and re-fueled. Once again the vehicle seemed ok and I had no more issues on my trip home. Last week I was driving home from work and suddenly I lost power in traffic. I was able to pull into a parking lot safely. This time the vehicle performed as if it was a manual transmission that had been knocked out of gear. Pushing the gas pedal did absolutely nothing. I had my Rogue towed to a local dealership and waited on their response. On Monday I found out that the transmission needed to be replaced at a cost of $4,200. I also found out that my powertrain warranty was only good up to 60,000 miles. The dealership recommended I call Nissan Customer Service and plead my case. I explained my issue to a very empathetic rep and he told me I would hear something back within 24 hours. This morning I was told they would be unable to provide any assistance. She went on to tell me that if I had history of service they could consider a compromise. I told her that it was two isolated issues over the last year and both occurred after 60,000. I told her that I had researched the issue and it was a common problem with the CVT transmissions. She told me that unfortunately there was nothing they could do. I will never purchase another Nissan vehicle.',\n",

I really loved the shape and turbo performance of the vehicle, so I bought it and put thousands of saved money towards the purchase.  Once the car hit 34,000 miles, the transmission went and had to be replaced.  The dealership basically indicated that I was being overly concerned since \"it\\'s covered under warranty\".  Firstly, I like to travel and don\\'t appreciate getting stuck with a broken down car with no working transmission.  Secondly, it is great that it\\'s covered under warrantly; however, when I purchase a vehicle, I plan on having it past the 100,000 mile warranty.  I\\'ve purchased many vehicles in my lifetime and drove them far beyond 100,000 miles.  As soon as they replaced the transmission, I traded it in at a different dealership and I made sure that my second new vehicle does NOT have a CVT!  They are cheap transmissions.  Unfortunately, many new vehicles on the market are using CVTs.  I paid a lot of money for a car that I kept for less than 2 years.   I say shame on Nissan Motor Company as I do believe they know of this significant issue but continue selling these cars.  I contacted Nissan Motor Company, but they couldn\\'t care less.',\n",

I believe it was built with one or more of the stops that are supposed to be in the armrest to keep it from moving freely were left out during manufacture but the dealer - Fort Worth Toyota took no action to try to discover why it moves so freely.  Also the speedometer reads about 4  mph high and when I took it back to Fort Worth Toyota, they overlaid a photo of a GPS speed over a laptop computer video of the speedometer and said it was accurate at 70 mph, but that is a bold faced lie.  I have since talked to a number of other owners of RAV4s and they also have the inaccurate speedometers going all the way back to the 2008 RAV4.  If the speedometer is reading high, it is probably also recording mileage driven as 4 miles high which probably helps them advertise that their vehicles get better gas mileage than the really do.  The US justice department should look into this as this is another example of what Volkswagen did with their diesel engines.  The width of the windshield supports on each side of the car and the way they are angled create very large blind spots making it hard to see coming vehicles when you are turning either right or left.  The clock is angled up and is partially shielded from view by the navigation screen and is really small so it can't be seen most of the time.  Also the display in the instrument panel where they show the temperature is extremely small and almost unusuable.  To make a long story short, I will never buy another Toyota as this is the worst vehicle I have ever owned and I would encourage others to not buy Toyotas either as their maintenance department is terrible and will not attempt to try to fix problems with their cars.\",\n",

Not recommend Toyota to my friends.Last service experience 2017 at Toyota Auto nation for my 2014 Toyota.  Just came in to replace one tire that had a punctureAt the left front tire and an oil and filter change. Seems simple for one hour job!All my four tires were still good and still had a lot of traction and treads on all my four tires. Instead I was being sold by Oscar to buy four new Michelin tires for about $755 installed.  I felt there was something fishy and untrue to what he was saying about my tires. He was very insistent to sell the new tires. Something dishonest so I declined.Instead of a mere 1 hour for an oil and filter change it took almost 3 hours and I wondered what they were doing? Oscar told me they were fixing it.  Guess what, after I declined to buy tires from Oscar, after waiting 3 hours, when I returned homeI found the left front tire that had a puncture was now in the left rear and I found the 3 other new tires that I hadHas been replaced by Toyota with 3 old tires with very minimum tire treads. What a service. What a disappointment. What a dishonesty. What a bunch of thieves. I lost sleep over it and I am sure they will deny it so what's the point of dealing with dishonest service shop.  So I went to another shop to buy all four new tires aligned and installed for only $640. I was very happy with this shop. I was very angry with Toyota and will never buy from them again.\",\n",

All these problems are known for year 2007 and 2008 Camry, just search them, there are technical service bulletins (tsb). Around 65k miles. The engine started burning oil, took the car to diagnostic they said it was normal, and sent me a letter if it was getting worst it would be covered under warranty.

I purchased this after owning the two other vans thinking i would get the same great usage, and bullet-proof reliability. Unfortunately there is a design flaw with the 2005-2016 Toyota Sienna\\'s where the L Bracket that holds the door to the van bends over time with usage, and causes the rear ECU to malfunction, which in turn causes the rear power sliding doors to randomly open. This fantastic feature of the new van\\'s happens at random moments, and random speeds. I contacted Toyota, because my van was out of warranty, at 36,300 miles, \"missed it by 300 miles\", who continued to indicate that this was a known issue, and that they would cover half of the cost to repair the issue, and i would only have to come out of pocket 5771.00, which is the cost for half.. mind you they also indicated that this is a known issue.. Not happy with that outcome i contacted the NHTSB with the issue, and was told there have been 36K reports of the same issue occurring on Sienna Van\\'s dating back to 2005, and that the last generation had a quiet recall, where Toyota extended the warranty on the doors, and repaired the issues free of charge, but this was never released as public knowledge.. The NHTSB indicated that they can\\'t force a recall until someone dies.. I would suggest you avoid these vans like the plague if you love your family..

In the first 6 months it spent about 51 days in the shop, and to continue going back to the dealer every other week or so get’s to the point of insanity! After speaking with my attorney about going through the lemon law I was told without a doubt you qualify for the program, but with that same doubt you would NOT prevail. Toyota corporate was well aware the I would not prevail hence the the stone wall.On the surface Toyota sounds and looks like a great consumer friendly company.  In my case the fought me all the way.',\n",

Nissan to this point has not been helpful in any way even though they know that this is a very common problem on a very poorly manufactured design, would tell anyone and everyone to steer clear of this vehicle with the cvt transmission.',\n",

We are loyal Honda owners however we figured we'd give a Toyota a chance. We bought a used 2007 RAV4 with clean car fax from a reputable dealer and low miles (72k,  which for a nine-year-old car is great).   The dealership had changed the oil and done a complete tuneup before selling the car to us, however we had the oil change just 3000 miles later  after we bought it and the person changing our oil said he couldn't believe the car was still functioning because there was almost no oil left. This is a consistent problem with Toyotas. We also had issues with the engine making noises and check engine light coming on sporadically. The car would shake and rattle and we had to have the oil changed four times in the less than six months we owned it. The worst part was when the air conditioner died and all of the coolant was leaking out through the front onto the driver and passenger's feet!! The car would shake and rattle and we had to have the oil changed four times in the less than six months me owned it. The worst part was when the air conditioner died and all of the coolant was leaking out through the front onto the driver and passenger side's feet!  Worst money we ever spent. If you're considering buying a used RAV4, please look into the fact that this year had over 12 recalls alone. There are known issues and the dealerships and Toyota are not good at taking care of these issues. They tried to put a Band-Aid on them and people like me suffer. I shouldn't have needed to buy a new car six months after owning this one. It is such a shame. From now on I am only buying Honda. For those of you thinking about this model please run don't walk. Look for a 2001 or 2002 Honda CRV. Much more reliable or you could get a Honda element which is even larger interior space and much more dependable.\",\n",

              " {'sequence': ' Bought this car from  Enterprise car sales, with about 30,000 miles on it. About 10,000 miles after I purchased the car, with normal driving, the transmission totally failed and needed to be replaced. This was covered under the manufactures warranty, so at least there’s that which makes almost getting stranded in the Mohave Desert somewhat less terrible.  About 10,000 miles after that the left rear turn signal went out several times, each of which required a separate repair. About 10,000 miles after that, while driving at pretty much any speed more notably on the freeway, I would lose all ability to accelerate.  After taking it to the dealership several times, they figured out that the onboard computer for some reason thought I had my foot on the brakes at random times and was cutting the acceleration, in advertently putting myself and other drivers at risk. About 12,000 miles later, the radiator fan failed,  and due to lack of any indication from the car that there was any problem, the car overheated. Got the radiator fan fixed, but now almost immediately after that I am noticing weird jumpiness in the RPMs. Also if I roll both windows up at the same time while idling,  The RPMs stutter...?! And different car is idling and I hit the AC button, the whole car jerks and the RPMs drop very low. This car behaves so strangely and poorly, I am nervous and feel unsafe anytime I am driving it. It feels at any moment the car will break down for the last time. I  have owned this POS for only about a year and a half, and have taken pretty good care of it. But it seems determined to die. Pretty sure the transmissions going to go again in a month or so. So two transmission replacements while the car is still under 80k miles......wow Nissan. I will never ever buy another Nissan again. I hope that these words prevent another from making the same mistake I did.',\n",

Because the dealer could not confirm the leaking gasket, I brought the car to a garage that specializes in foreign cars which gave me a quote of $10,000 to replace leaking Valve Seals, and noted that once they opened the engine they could find additional leaks.  I went back to New Country BMW and explained to them the diagnostic I received, and was told yes these cars are known for leaking valve seals and there is a possibly that the cylinder head gaskets need to be replaced also for an additional $10,000 and $4,000 for the leaking antifreeze repair.  Yes, I brought the car used, but who would think with the original price BMW charges for these vehicles that the engine would get more than 100,000.  I have driven Infiniti's for far over $150,000 miles..\",\n",

In the middle of driving I suddenly lose power as if I let off the gas pedal, only I don't. It just starts coasting and wont respond to me pushing down on the accelerator. All the electrical power stays intact. The RPMs stay around 1 no matter how far down I push the gas pedal. The most serious incident occurred a day ago. I pulled out from a stop sign. As I turned right I accelerated to 10 mph then nothing. No response to me pushing the gas pedal.  I floored it, nothing. I eased into it, nothing. It slowed to 5 mph and crept until I could pull off on a side street.  I put it in park and back in drive and it seemed to do the trick. If I had been crossing traffic I would have stalled and been hit by an oncoming car. The first time this incident happened I was cruising along at 40 mph when it just died on me. It slowed to 15 mph as I pushed to accelerator. It happened over 3-5 seconds. All of a sudden it came back to life and leaped up in RPMs. I emailed Nissan a week ago when it first happened. No response. I emailed them this time. No response. I called them and they have instructed I take it in to a dealer, which I will. It is 2016 certified pre-owned. Its a nice truck but of course not worth risking someone's life/health. Needless to say I'm a regretful owner.\",\n",

This is even though the car ran perfectly for the entire 5 week period and 2500 miles after the rain event without even the slightest vibration. What they couldn\\'t explain, at all, was how enough water made it past the air cleaner without getting the air cleaner wet or damaged! The rain event did short a couple electronic systems as error codes indicated and put the car into a \"limp-home\" mode, but were simply cleared and reset after I had them checked. Interestingly, the service advisor and a service manager kept aggressively encouraging me to \"just file a claim with your insurance carrier\" and that \"people have been doing it there all the time\"! It seemed like a \"go-to\" line for these guys even though any competent mechanic would conclude that this engine did not \"blow\" due to water damage! I checked with a few!  It has been my experience here that BMW, through their authorized representatives, will do anything possible to avoid responsibility in honoring their warranty including encouraging their customers to commit insurance fraud.

To the 2007 model year they also added broken rear leaf springs.  I can tell that a breaking leaf spring at 70 miles per hour is VERY scary and dangerous.  The entire rear of the truck jumped several feet in the air and although I was able to maintain control, it turned out that half of the bottom spring fell off and in the process damaged my rear break lines and the fuel tank (not punctured).OK you may say so they will fix it - it's a recall.  Yes, I was told that this would be repaired on my 2007 (there are several years that were not included in the recall although many people reported similar problems.

The steering wheel is about 1 to 1 and a half inches offset from the center of the seat mostly an annoyance.  The CD player was unable to play the disk that I routinely used in my other, old vehicles.The accelerator pedal is way too touch, a hallmark of this age of Toyota, it takes concentration to leave a light smoothly.  Between the touchy accelerator and the light rear end it was hard to deal with any slick pavement and it tended to wander on dirt roads.  The seat belt retraction lacked a decent return spring, the previous owner was not careful and as a result the belt tang had gouged the door sill multiple times from being caught when the door was closed.    The engine is powerful but has a groaning sound, not pleasing at all, more like it is straining.  At 10 years old and 40k miles the dealer informed me that it needed a timing belt every 8 years or 100,000 miles and while they are in there they like to replace the water pump since the Japanese engineers put the water pump behind the timing belt.  That was a $1200 job.  The water pump was leaking at 40,000 miles.  My Dakota water pump lasted 120,000 miles and 14 years.

              " {'sequence': \" We enjoyed our Quest for the first five years. The van had a smooth ride. I liked the interior layout with the folding seats and no need to remove large middle-row seats. We could haul large objects without having to remove clunky middle row seats, and we thought we were getting a better quality van than a Chrysler product. With the back two rows of seats folded flat, we had a bedding area for long trips to Florida. The hidden trunk in the back provided nice storage. We were making some nice memories with our van. In the first year or two we started to worry a little when our van would stall on downhill angles with 1/4 tank of gas or less. A technical service bulletin software update fixed that problem with no cost.  Routine maintenance generally kept our van rolling along. Second set of tires at just over 40,000miles and that set lasted nearly 60,000 miles. Brakes replaced at about 88,000 miles. Only unexpected repair had been a rear A/C line at 80,000 miles. Well, things began going bad in the last few months. The van began lurching or having RPM surges while driving at speed--especially with cruise set while going up a small grade or hill. Was that the transmission slipping? The problem happened rarely enough that our local Nissan dealer could not replicate it during a test drive. Then after the 105,000 mile service the transmission problems worsened. On a long trip we had lots of cruising on the freeway. The tachometer would bounce while maintaining speed. If we encountered a hill the RPMs might bounce from 2000 up to 2400 with no gain in speed. The bounce lasted a second or two and it occurred on minor inclines. Local driving too and from work seemed fine, but then a short trip to family was the last straw. A couple times on this trip shifting from reverse to drive produced a clunking sound with marginal acceleration. (That can't be good.) We had two or three episodes in which the van took a long time to move from a stop on an uphill grade. (That experience seemed marginally dangerous.) Then the check engine light confirmed our fears. We nursed it back to our dealer. The tranny was dead. We are now two weeks into waiting for a replacement. Five years with the van was fine, but then we learned the error of our ways in purchasing the Nissan Quest with the CVT. Our dealer is still waiting for a replacement transmission while we kick ourselves for not purchasing the Honda, Toyota, or even the Chrysler. While it may not help our efforts to unload this thing in a year or so, buyers should beware of Nissan CVTs...especially in the Quest. A quick contact with corporate produced the expected apology for inconvenience with no real help.  Five years old and just over 100,000 miles and the transmission pukes? Please learn from our experience.Update in 2018: So we had the dealer replace the transmission at 107,800 miles and hoped for the best. After another 5,000 miles or so, my wife began to worry about being stranded if the new transmission puked. I thought that we could just drive it into the ground. After laying out over $3,000 for a replacement transmission, I was not eager to get rid of the vehicle. My opinion began to change when I noticed hesitation shifting from reverse to drive. Initially I thought it was just paranoia because of the first transmission failing. The issue happened a few times, with a hesitation and a lurch. Okay, I am not the guy to leave my wife driving a marginally reliable vehicle (or maybe it gave me an excuse to shop for a replacement). We decided to replace the van, and we sold it with a little over 116,000 miles on it...about 5 months after replacing the transmission. (Sigh) Not a great experience, and I wish that we had purchased a Toyota back in 2012. Live and learn. Nissan, you lost me with this one.\",\n",

There is poor storage area, and push button start makes it worse with more stuff Keys)to set somewhere! the certer armrest storage is horrible, no where to have a pen handy,Ok seats, super hard!!! no comfortable at all. Im always trying to readjust to relax my butt.the tilt wheel does not tilt down far enough, and does not telescope  far enough. plus both are controlled by only one lever. so the tilt up upon exit usually retracts the telescope as well, so constant adjusting. I had to put the seat much closer to the dash than I like do to steering position issues. the window controls are wrong. when the arm is on the panel, my fingers are on top of the mirror controls, kinda not where then need to be!I dislike the radio controls. as you change presets your actually going down on the wheel, yet your preset stations are going up in sequence. very confusing. I guess setting up the presets backward will help. The materials on the radio controls are cheap. also, the HD is constantly going in and out, making radio loud, then quiet. Ill turn it off, but as soon as you change the station, its active again. The screen on the radio and climate are slanted at a poor angle, the sun hits them and you cant see anything!! they need to perhaps be tiltable so as to avoid sun glare. OK the car is automatic, always wandering for a gear, and has sport shift option and!!! paddle shifter! really? why waste that much mony on 3 shifting options in an AVALON? The a/c vents are horrible!!! you can cool the body from the chest up, or from knees down, but there are NO vents to cool your mid section. the \"auto\" to cool the car, does not work well, it activates vents only, not the floor vents, and it doesnt turn on high, you have to adjust it. some of the controls are just touch and some are PUSH, so wierd trying to remember what ones you have to push hard. The review camera has not helped me at all. I do like that the mirrors tilt down upon reverse though. the brakes kinda suck, it feels like they are going to warp if I push hard. I am a single guy 35, drive the car in eco all the time trying to be gentle. This car is neither luxury as I thought, or sport as they are trying. its simply a glorified Maxima, that is a let down on all fronts.Update as of 7-13-2016 I still dislike the car with 4200 miles. I would NOT buy it again.',\n",

              " {'sequence': ' I\\'ve owned this car for a little over two years. Prior to that, I had a 4-speed 2001 Corolla CE that I owned for 5 years. Pros:- The engine is a typical Toyota engine, which means it hasn\\'t changed much over the years. While it might lack some of the power compared to its competitors, I\\'d be pretty confident with it lasting a long time.- The CVT isn\\'t too bad in this vehicle. Toyota put in artifical shift points so it feels more like a conventional transmission. Reliability seems to be pretty good as I haven\\'t seen any failures posted online.- The interior is pretty nice. The S model has some nice stitching that makes it feel upscale.- The back seats are pretty roomy and comfortable. Granted, this generation is larger than the past ones, but it\\'s good if you need to shuttle people.- MPGs are pretty good. I get 35 average with mixed city/highway driving. This drops to 32 in the winter. But I\\'m in general pretty light on the throttle.Cons:- The headlights are awful. I don\\'t understand how so many people rated them as good. There\\'s a \"lid\" on the LED headlights to prevent it shining out too much. What this does is creates a sharp cut-off for low-beams. To make things worse, because the lights are bright white, it means you can\\'t see anything beyond the cut-off point. It also is very blinding to other drivers. I can\\'t stand it when another Corolla comes up behind me. I honestly try to avoid driving at night with this car, but that becomes impossible to do in winter. I never had this issue with my old car.- Handling is poor and requires a lot of manual correction. The steering doesn\\'t transmit a lot of feedback to the driver.- The CVT loves to rev up everytime you apply the gas even in small amounts. This causes the engine RPMs to jostle around a lot. Even with the artifical shift points, it\\'s still a CVT at the end of the day and rather dull. Engine braking with it is barely there as it\\'s designed for fuel economy.- The Entune system doesn\\'t allow mp3 files and folders to be read like a directory on a computer. It insists on reading all the tags and sorting them that way. If you want to play files on a USB stick or CD, make sure they are all tagged correctly first.- The dashboard and interior lights are all bright blue or white and are constantly illuminated. I\\'d much prefer a softer color for night driving.- The automatic headlights were removed in this generation. Between this and the previous issue, I\\'ve seen other Corolla drivers with headlights off at dusk. That\\'s not a good thing at all.If it wasn\\'t for the headlight issue, this would be another Corolla that I would keep for many years. But because of the headlight issue, I\\'m probably going to trade it in for something else.',\n",

But I wished a thousand times I would have gotten a different vehicle!   I would love to sale this Camry now!  Or if I could turn it back in and get a refund...I would completely satisfied!   I can honestly say I hate my new Toyota Camry. 2016.   It may have several airbags for safety but the way they are arranged in car is mind boggling and blinds your vision to things outside you should be aware of on the road!  Yessirreee.....my eyes are tired from squinting to see how to drive this vehicle and yes I hate the whole package!!',\n",

Nissan, shame on you! (My 2006 Xterra S is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned...) The early pics of the new Titan were concerning;  it looked like a mash-up of various other brands, and just way overdone, e.g. the ridiculous emblems on the front fenders. Still, I wanted to see the truck in person and drive the beast. When it finally arrived at a close-enough dealer, I made the trip. Talk about a let-down! This thing is an abomination. Just WAY too big for a \\'tweener. Maybe it should be marketed to WWE performers, because it\\'s so massive in every respect. Except performance. Sluggish acceleration, and despite having a price tag at or above \"real\" heavy duty trucks, it does not provide real heavy duty truck capabilities. The SV I looked at and drove had an MSRP of $55k, and the dealer wasn\\'t going to \"move much\" off that price. Yet I could buy a RAM 2500 with the awesome Cummins 6.7 liter diesel and its 370 HP and 800 (!!) ft-lbs of torque -- for $51k after dealer markdowns. In summary, I could buy this new Titan (and I was truly a Nissan advocate, having owned five of their vehicles in the last 15 years) with less capability and unproven reliability but pay more for it, vs. a proven star heavy duty truck in the RAM mentioned. No contest. Unless Nissan cuts their pricing by $10k, I don\\'t know why anybody would opt for the \\'XD\\'. I would be astonished if Nissan meets their sales expectations with this XD. On the other hand, they sold what, like 12k Titans in all of 2015? (Ford sells that many F150s in a week...) Thumbs down, and a Bronx jeer to Nissan for letting their Frontier and Xterra become old and obsolete. New models should have been released several years ago, including a diesel option and better/more adjustable SEATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made a big mistake to buy the 2015 Camry SE instead  of researching more on a Honda Accord or Nissan Altima.  The Camry was way under power and it made so much road noise on highway as though you were driving a 10 year old car.  Braking system is pretty bad that you have to press hard on brake for a stop.  The seats are rough and pain in the butt after an hour drive (not comfort at all).  The only good thing on this car is having more space and leg room and a back up camera as a standard compare to the previous model. So as you read this, do try to give yourself a good test drive on highway if you really want a Camry.  My guess you better off with the LE model since the struts are not stiff and you have a normal tires.  Anyway, regardless of what model of Camry you buy (4 or 6 cylinders) they are all under power and it will make you very frustrated for the money you paid.  I later try a test drive on a Nissan Altima and the Honda Accord and what I would say both the Nissan and the Accord are excellent  drive and comfort.  If in the scale 1-10 of rating I would rate the Camry 5 and the Altima/Accord would be 9. One more thing to note, The Nissan Altima is the best for the comfort, space, and gas mileage.',\n",

Historically they have been reliable...then we bought a new $55,000 Sequoia Limited (4WD) in 2010.  So far (between 2010-2015) we have spent over $5,000.00 in repairs on the Sequoia!  The combo GPS/radio completely failed just out of the warranty period and we had to have it rebuilt.  The brakes on this vehicle have always had major problems - going down any appreciable hill causes the rotors to hot-spot and/or warp, resulting in an alarming steering wheel shimmy. The alternator went out at just under 70,000 miles and we took it to Toyota for repairs.  We were told that both the timing chain cover seal and pan seal were leaking and this is what caused the alternator to fail.  The Toyota Dealer held us for ransom - indicating that they wouldn't warranty the new alternator unless we had the timing chain cover & pan seals replaced!  Ultimately, (after the dealer had the vehicle for nearly 2 full weeks) the repair cost was > $4,100.00!!!  It would seem to me that Toyota would have a little pride and make good on the seal repairs since clearly there is some sort of problem with their vehicles leaking from multiple seals at less than 70,000 miles...but we couldn't even get Toyota to return our calls! The service representative told us that the Sequoia was made in Texas and that they aren't nearly as reliable as Toyota's made in Japan... that has become abundantly clear to us.  Bought my first new Toyota Longbed truck in 1984 for $5,800.00...I've nearly spent that much on repairs for the 2010 Sequoia.\",\n",

So, took vehicle to dealer 50 miles away.  They immediately recognized the problem, but, listen to this, were not able to make immediate repairs.  They had to call Nissan for authorization.  First Nissan told dealer to change tires and wheels with another vehicle, hoping that issue was tires/wheels.  Well, that didn\\'t work, so Nissan told dealer to replace torque converter.  Done, now the problem was worse,  Finally, dealer told to replace transmission.  Finally, problem solved.  Problem was, I was traveling and need substitute transportation.  Nissan did pay part of rental.  Due to substandard treatment by Nissan, I traded to vehicle for new Toyota Highlander limited in 1/15.

Since then, this car has been in the shop at least 4 maybe 5 times (pretty bad that it's so many times that I can no longer keep count). The first three times, it was in the shop were within in month period. The transmission kept failing, and the car wouldn't start. The first time it started failing, I was driving on the highway and was unable to pick up speed. Was pretty sure I was going to die. Nissan's engineers looked at it and failed to fix it two times because the problem kept happening. I guess the third time was the charm. But they were happy to take our money each time just the same. One of the times, my husband was driving the car to the dealership to get the problem addressed and it stalled out while he was taking a left turn. He nearly got killed because a car was coming. The transmission, slow to pick up, picked up at the last second. Since then, the car has seemed fine aside from the minor annoyances, such as the bluetooth randomly not working, the screen going wonky, the speakers sounding bad, and the tire pressure being all over the place. Nissan gave us a car with paper-thin break pads (we totally could have died), a small hole in one of the tires, and a shitty transmission. Now, the car jerks back and forth when accelerating and decelerating (but only from time to time). Nissan was happy to drive it around, waste our gas, say nothing was wrong, and take another $250 for doing NOTHING. 2013 Nissan Altimas are LEMONS. DO NOT BUY ONE.

The whole car sounded like it was coming apart.  The dash rattled, power seats squealed, and the speakers vibrated at low volume.  Just all around poor build quality.  I took it in to my local dealer because the passenger occupancy sensor would intermittently turn the air bags off when I have a passenger in the front seat.  The service technician at the dealership was unable to reproduce the problem, this was back in 2014.  To my amazement I received a recall last month addressing this very issue, and there's another open recall for the fuel pump!  I'm sure there will be more recalls to come.  The climate controls were impossible to adjust.  They were either on full heat or cold; no in between.  The CVT destroys any illusion of power.  I guess the last straw was the incompetent technicians and rude service manager at my local dealership.  I'm so happy I traded it in!

The three worst problems are; ROAD NOISE, NAVIGATION (Voice commands) and FRONT SEAT COMFORT.  These three problems, alone, make road trips terrible.  The road noise level is so high that to hear the radio, the volume needs to be very high.  The Voice command feature is unusable at highway speeds due to the road noise. Combine this with the seat comfort and I don't want to take long trips.  I guess you need to go to a two week course on using the navigation system.  Nothing is intuitive, I guess that you can do a lot with this system but finding information, while driving, is difficult at best (I'm still trying to learn this system).  There are several other smaller problems; the display screen is washed out during the day by the sunlight, the digital speedometer does not match the needle speedometer and other small issues.  Keep in mind this is the XLE Camry (one step below the Avalon) and should much much better.  I hate to admit it but I rode in a Nissan Altima yesterday and found it much quieter and more comfortable than my Camry (I have never been a Nissan fan, maybe should re-evaluate the Nissan).  I'll take my 2001 Camry LE over this one any day.  I fail to see why this Camry is rated so high by many people, confused!UPDATE (2/19/2017):Letters were sent to Toyota Headquarters in California and to Southeast Toyota headquarters and were ignored.  Took the car to the dealership for service and was basically ignored (you can show them and demonstrate the issues and they just shake their head and say they don't see a problem, must be corporate brainwashing).  Was so disappointed with this car that I traded it in for a Mercedes in November 2017 (lost money on the Toyota, of course).  My advise is to rent before you buy to really get to know the car.\",\n",

This is technically out of warranty, but far to early to be expecting an $1000 repair. I contacted Nissan One, and asked if they would be willing to stand behind their product due to the fact that it still had relatively low miles. They said they first needed to have a Nissan garage look at the problem before they could say. The local garage already had diagnosed the problem, but Nissan wanted to charge me $100 to do so. After spending a long morning waiting at the dealership, I sent Nissan the information, and they declined to help cover the $1000 bill for the repairs, offering no apparent reason. Perhaps it is unfair to fault them, it wasn't under warranty, but if I had it to do over again, I'd look for a company willing to stand behind their product a little better, and that won't cost you a bundle before you ever hit the 100,000 mark.\",\n",

I took it on the freeway and when I got to 70mph I noticed vibration coming out from the front wheels. I am not sure if it is simply a balance issues or something more serious but the fact of the matter is that it should of been tested before me and fixed. This is SUPER unacceptable considering they want 60k for the car to have vibration coming out of the front wheels that I surely noticed.  Overall everything else seems to be ok. I really liked Sound System and how soft it accelerated and drove. It was pretty quiet when compared to other cars in the same class. I also did not like that if you want to get some nice options like Premium seats with Ventilation you have to get a Package, same with LED Lights and Sport wheels with suspension. By the time I add everything I want on the car it cost about 80k, which is high considering it is only a 5 series car and NOT even 6 or 7 series. Dealer also seemed like not care much since they are selling them fast and they do not care about their customers.

I had to get the Platinum Series to get all the safety features and AC seats but lost a second row seats. There is no option for a second row bench. The Platinum is now a 7 passenger vehicle, not 8 as advertised. The lease program for toyotas are way too expensive. The same class of vehicle in Lexus or Mercedes is $400 a month cheaper. The Navigation system is the worst of any, repeat any car out there. Its located 6 inches to the right of center closer to the passenger than the driver. Its not inset so the Florida sun glare makes it impossible to read. When you can read it the print is too small and leaning over to the right to use the touch pad or see the back up camera is unsafe. I repeat, its unsafe to use. The voice controls are useless as it takes 3-5 tries to get it to understand. I gave up and put my garmin between the steering where I can see it. I cant wait to get rid of this car.\",\n",

In January of 2018 I leased the third, an M550i Xdrive.  It's nice looking, is pretty quick and it's fun to drive.  I took possession in the winter and around April I noticed the AC didn't cool...just blew hot air.  I took it in to the dealer who charged up the system and kept it for a week looking for leaks.  Didn't find any.  Car was returned and enjoyed great AC until late June.  Just today (June 24th) the AC went from cold air to cool and finally warm in less than an hour.  Now I have to make a long hot drive to bring the car back in to the dealer next week.  I get a loaner but it's an inferior model (except for the AC).  I've only had the car for 180 days but I'm already half way to officially being able to declare the vehicle a Lemon under Texas law.  Two other annoying things are the music connection and the wireless charging.  For music I mostly use Pandora through my iPhone X.  The connection to the car is unreliable and I generally have to restart my phone to get it to play.  I've used both the BMW app and Apple Car Play.  I definitely wouldn't recommend the $300 Car Play option.  The wireless charger is hit and miss as well.  I've used two phones that are Qi charger capable and both sometimes work in the car and sometimes don't.  They both charge perfectly on the wireless charger at home.   In summary the car drives well, but the AC and the electronics problems make the car a poor choice if you're a driver who wants his $90,000 car to work as advertised.  If you're wondering why I gave it two stars rather than one, it's because the AC problem doesn't matter in the winter.\",\n",

A shopping cart with a heavy bag of dog food got away from the customer and headed across the parking lot and I didn’t see it and backed into it damaging a small section of the back bumper.  The car didn’t indicate that there was something headed for the back of the vehicle and it didnt indicate there was a collision.  I was so upset I thought I hit someone with the car!  I was relieved that it was a shopping cart and not a pedestrian.  Every time I look at the bumper I see the damage that could have been a child on a bike that could have died due to the poor/deceptive safety specs of the vehicle.  I think god everyday that it was just a shopping cart.  I no longer trust the safety specs and rely on the mirrors.  I don’t even trust the rear camera or the blind spot indicators.  It’s a cute sporty SUV and it’s very comfortable and can handle well in snow and on curves.  It has poor acceleration performance especially driving up a hill and accelerating onto highways.  There is no brake assist at all not even a little bit.  I also almost hit a tree head on during one of the nor’easters due to the poor visibility.  I diverted hitting the tree that was laying across the road the last second.  That’s when I realized the from indicators aren’t reliable either.  So if you are looking for a sporty vehicle without the safety specs this is the perfect buy.  If you are looking for a safe family SUV with all the safety specs you need to steer away from this and run.  The Rogue and subuaru are the safer bet.',\n",

(a warning is fine but constant loud noise makes me dislike this car).   (4) The car is very hard to program and much too hard for me to even begin to explore the options available.    (5) I cannot find any way to have more than one cell phone connected at a time, so I am unable to have both my phone and my wife\\'s phone connected (one or the other at a time).   (6) The feature that shuts down the engine while at a stop light is very agitating and should be a option to either always on or always off.  Lastly I would like to comment on the dealership.

Interior space is great you can have all shape and sizes inside with no real issues a big plus if you have kids with car seats. Since we got ours “certified preowned” low miles its always done a wierd vibration when running especially if the ac is on dealer says its nothing but my 2007 altima never did it. Since we have had it (11/2013) we have had to replace 2 racking pinions 2 mast flow air sensor which in that instance the dealer charged 500.00 when the part alone at autozone was like 100.00 if that but since it wasnt a “nissan” part of course they suggested to replace it in order to reset the cars computer so the check engine light would go out. Mind you we arent done paying it and it wouldnt even pass smog last year in order to change the plates. We have owned from Xterras to pathfinders to frontiers as well as a sentra we WERE die hard nissan until this one now we are AVOIDING nissan AT ALL COST!!!! -side note the darn car couldnt make it to vegas without loosing power 2 years ago coming from Southern California imagine that seeing a beat up bucket just passing you buy as your semi new altima can even make it up the hill-the drive was only 3 hrs which turned into 5!!!',\n",

I loved driving her, took on trips to CA, WA, Portland, Idaho. She was a great vehicle until her brakes failed in November of 2015. I hit a parking island on a dark rainy night in an unlit parking lot. When I stepped on the brakes to stop, the vehicle kept going. I hit 2 other vehicles then a tree before she finally stopped. I am grateful for the safety features of the front bumper and crumple zones on the body. I was wearing my seat belt. However, there was no logical explanation for the brake failure. The vehicle had just been serviced the week before, and I had had no squeaking or problems with the brakes. I still suffer pain in my left shoulder and leg from the accident. My insurance company paid my medical bills for a year, but now the cost is on me. My insurance company also later researched the vehicle and found out there was a recall for the master brake cylinder. Toyota Motor Company never notified me of this recall. For anyone buying a Toyota Highlander, I would highly recommend having the brakes checked thoroughly.',\n",

All service except oil changes have been done by the local Toyota dealer.  My wife was pulling out of the driveway when the ABS/VSC lights came on and the console said to pull over.   A code scan said it was C1391, internal acc pressure leak.  Took it to the dealer.  They said it needed a new brake accumulator and a new brake booster for a total of OVER $5000!   Researching the issue, I found it is a fairly common issue for these cars.  When I called Toyota to ask if the cost of this repair, equal to 1/3 the cost of the vehicle, could be mitigated, I eventually got a woman who told me that since I didn't take the car in to the dealer for nearly a year in 2015, I was not a loyal Toyota customer and they have chosen not to help me.  REALLY!!??  The car didn't NEED any service during that time!   I own 5 other cars including a couple of BMWs and I have NEVER had a repair this expensive and have NEVER been admonished by an automobile company representative for not getting a car serviced when it didn't need it.

It\\'s loud /very noticeable and makes one wonder how long before the rattle progresses or wears out internal moving parts (ruins the top end or all of the engine). My Camry has this problem. My dealer acknowledged the problem and was instructed to replace (1) cam and did.. It did NOT solve the problem. Took it in again (Vancouver, Wa Toyota) , they kept it for a week (agreed it was still an issue) and sent me home with my Camry that still has the same pronounced cold start rattle.

After several months we sent the car tot Tulsa OK to be used by my son at college; the car presented some noise getting worse with time. When taking the car to the leader it was determine by the dealer that it was a result of an error performed during the transmission replacement. The technician left a bolt loose or too tight stripping the bolt and causing a possible safety issue. The dealer kept the car for 10 days on a \"waiting for parts status\" after these ten days and calling and pushing the dealer for the repair od the vehicle. We were notified that the dealer at CA denied our claim and there is nothing they can do. I contacted Nissan directly and tried to get them to honor the extended warranty and their response was. Nothing that they can do, that the dealers are \"independent\" of Nissan and I should deal directly with the dealer at Tracy CA.  Nissan is not being accountable for the bad performance or training of their technician or services provided by their dealers. Sure they will push you to utilize their services as for warranty requirements, but they are not willing to cover for their mistakes. Now I was required to sign to take my vehicle back and release them for any responsibility because now it is a safety issue.  If you are expecting that you will have a NATIONAL service form Nissan you are wrong and you are left alone to be the victim of a poor service and quality of their products.

I was, at the time, looking for a 5k-8k car....after many failed attempts at purchasing a liable car, I decided to finance a car at Napoli Nissan in Milford CT. Of course, I purchased the Rogue. I was estatic! Loved my choice... A few months into it, it was driving a little weird so I was told it may be my tires. I bought 4 Brand new tires....No big deal. Not long after, the weird feeling came back...brought it back to Napoli...they told me it was my TRANSMISSION....at this point my car only had about 60k miles....Napoli told me it would be costly and advised me to reach out to NISSAN Headquarters for support. MY NISSAN ROGUE IS A 2012 WITH 60K MILES. I reached out to Nissan on several occasion, asking for any financial support - I was turned down because my car was a few miles off of warranty and BECAUSE they said, I never brought my car to NAPOLI for any services... so I was not a \"loyal customer\\' Sorry mam, there\\'s nothing I can do. 25 year old female with a Nissan Rogue for about 6-7 months and in need of new TRANSMISSION... for the record, I got my new tires at NAPOLI, bought it back and left it on 2 different occasions for service needs but SHE CLAIMED i was not a \"loyal customer\" and therefor, could not be helped.... NISSAN used to be my dream car, not it\\'s just a headache sitting in my sister\\'s driveway because a new transmission will cost me about $3500... I work with under served High school students who read at a grade 3 or 4 level...$3500 is a lot of money that I do not have... especially when I just spent nearly $500 to get new brakes. I bought the car back to Napoli a 3rd time, begging for help...they told me all they could do is trade it in....I have student loans already...they trade in value was crap...they ran my credit 11 times without my permission and I left there with my car and no solution. I have no intention of going back to NAPOLI INDOORs nor do I ever plan on buying another Nissan after getting rid of this...thank you so much.',\n",

So far I can't say I'm impressed. If you need horsepower, you better keep looking. You won't find it with this car. And with the unique transmission that seems to gear down on take off, the car seems to have even less horsepower. If you need to step on the gas, get ready for a loud roar from the engine noise. It ain't pretty. Sounds like a darned airplane about to take off. I purchased the car brand new. You know the economics of buying a new car, so I'll lose my big time if I trade.\",\n",

I wish I have done it more my self but too late now.You can buy what you like but do a search on 2015 / 2016 sienna vibration or problems because it is true and it\\'s common. I have it too and can\\'t be fixed.Not doing enough researching for a family van I bought it because it was \"TOYOTA\" and have read good reviews on a 2015 Sienna with new improvements. Few days after the purchase around 300 miles on the Sienna. Feel dash, steering wheel and floor buzz vibration starting from complete stop on a hill when reaches 1150 to 1200 RPM (15~20 mph) and happens again after shifting to 2nd gear under 20 mph. Often passenger slider door gets stuck half way closing with beep and won\\'t go back or close with switch. While holding traffic at school drop off lane switch the door switch to manual then get out show my face to angry people and have to close it manually then it works fine for a while.Both rear slider door glass makes metal tapping noise when driving with window open more than 3\" under 15 ~25 miles. Sounds like glass rattling on the window channel seems like loose screw or no rubber on the channel.Front passenger door interior leather by the handle has wavy looks like from side view glue coming off or someone poked with fingers when gluing the upholstery.I have addressed these few concerns on my new sienna to the purchased dealer and they had some one from Toyota to inspect the Sienna.Conclusion to my concerns were that Toyota DSPM have compared to other sienna on the lot and since other Sienna does the same so it is normal and it is not warrantable and have no solution to correct the problems. Basically live with it or sell it because warranty is not going to cover it because it\\'s normal to them.Why is Toyota comparing with other vehicles and call it \" NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE VEHICLE \" when I want to find out how to correct the problems.Sounds like they have engineered to rattle, vibrate and no solution to the problems so live with it or sell it to someone else who can live with it.  Did I miss lists of \" NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE VEHICLE SHEET \" when I bought the van?If this is the case Toyota needs to disclosed on the catalog that these van does make noise & vibrations before the purchase not after the purchased.Not too happy and already lost interest in new vehicle less than a month. Warranty and Toyota customer is really bad. It\\'s a compared warranty not to correct them.I like the 2015 and up design but I am ready to sell my Sienna already for something else because I can not accept all these $37K normal vibrations and rattles came with the van plus Toyota said it\\'s normal too.My believe level in Toyota product is gone for good.

Last Toyota\",\n          \" I owned my Highlander for 10 years. I bought her used from a dealer in San Jose, CA in 2005. She drove just like a new vehicle. I loved driving her, took on trips to CA, WA, Portland, Idaho. She was a great vehicle until her brakes failed in November of 2015. I hit a parking island on a dark rainy night in an unlit parking lot. When I stepped on the brakes to stop, the vehicle kept going. I hit 2 other vehicles then a tree before she finally stopped. I am grateful for the safety features of the front bumper and crumple zones on the body. I was wearing my seat belt. However, there was no logical explanation for the brake failure. The vehicle had just been serviced the week before, and I had had no squeaking or problems with the brakes. I still suffer pain in my left shoulder and leg from the accident. My insurance company paid my medical bills for a year, but now the cost is on me. My insurance company also later researched the vehicle and found out there was a recall for the master brake cylinder. Toyota Motor Company never notified me of this recall. For anyone buying a Toyota Highlander, I would highly recommend having the brakes checked thoroughly.\",\n          \" When I purchased this car it was like driving a pocket rocket....loved it!  I took it to the dealer, for maintenance, and when they gave it back to me it didn't have any of the acceleration anymore.  I've been trying to work with Nissan and their dealers to get it back to my \\\"original\\\" experience.  Most dealer techs acknowledge that it doesn't perform the way a 3.5 SR should be performing; acceleration, handling, etc., but will only tell me that it's operating within specs.  The problem is, it seems that the dealers have (at most) only received one of these models so they're not familiar with the difference of having a 6 cylinder versus a 4 cylinder under the hood.  I don't know what to do, but would warn anyone thinking of purchasing the 3.5 SR....don't.  You may think you're buying that \\\"pocket rocket\\\", but after the dealer hooks it up to their diagnostics, you'll be driving the 2.5 version.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"service\",\n          \"design\",\n          \"comfort\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Score1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.1807977480593652,\n        \"min\": 0.009640740230679512,\n        \"max\": 0.9996588230133057,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2515,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.3923236131668091,\n          0.9327583312988281,\n          0.9711090922355652\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"efficiency \",\n          \"performance\",\n          \"price\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Score2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2138475549183057,\n        \"min\": 0.004334867000579834,\n        \"max\": 0.9978144764900208,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2515,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.40131527185440063,\n          0.6538646221160889,\n          0.5917550325393677\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Due to the expense, Toyota is taking the position that the noise in \\\"normal\\\" and not under warranty.

The moment I drive this Tacoma home after purchase the CEL goes off. ???  So I go to Auto Zone and it throws the dreaded PO171 lean bank code. So I buy a MAF sensor ( $75.00 )and nothing...code still on. Also noticed that my MPG was awful, getting around 13 mpg for a 18.5 gallon tank. So next I try the 2 Oxygen sensors upstream and downstream ($150) and still nothing, so I'm now thinking this tacoma truck is indeed a [non-permissible content removed] So I take the piece of garbage to the Toyota dealership and they keep the truck for 8 hours on a Saturday !!!!! and tell me truck has the wrong spark plugs and that's causing the PO171 code. $258 later they replace the spark plugs and clear the code and off I go. 8 miles down the road I noticed the piece of crap is misfiring out the tailpipe and CEL comes back on? So after a few more curse words I decide to take it back to dealership the next day and complain. After keeping the garbage truck for 5 hours they now tell me it could be the timing belt was off by a tooth and maybe the fuel injector needs to be replace.....$2,200.00 !!!! Are you fricking kidding me. ROFLMAO. So I take the truck home and the next day when I started, a huge black smoke comes out of tailpipe. Ugh. So I go get timing belt done on my own with a local mechanic and the cost was $500.00 with parts. Drive 4 miles down the road and CEL comes back on ? [non-permissible content removed] So now I replace the Fuel filter and still CEL on. After doing some research I find out that Toyota brand only likes DENSO sensors so I again replaced the 2 Oxygen sensors with DENSO and boom CEL goes off. So I actually drove 250 with NO CEL on but she kept misfiring out the tailpipe and hesitation. So I go and replace the fuel pump and still same issue. And then go after the gaskets and seals and replace them.Now I'm getting ready to dump this piece of garbage out to sea. So a few days later I noticed a funny gas smell coming from  the inside of the engine. What is up, now I have a leaking fuel injector ?? Another $450 to fix. And yep CEL comes back on and this time it's the bad sensor may set a P0401 code (insufficient EGR flow), or it may not set an EGR code but a P0171 and/or P0174 lean code instead. I'm going nuts !!!!! Fix the Fuel injector, reset the computer by disconnecting the battery. So Good riddance you [non-permissible conten removed] tacoma. Toyota got it wrong. DO NOT by a first generation Tacoma at all. Stay away !!!!!! Far away. The worst truck I have bought in my entire life and would not recommend a first generation Tacoma to anyone. GRADE F\",\n          \" I had Corolla for 9 years. I had no problem with that except for its slow pickup and not-good for high speed (over 65) travel. But with Camry I am having back/hip pain because of poor interior design. Gear shift is not smooth, it gets stuck in there. Seating comfort is very poor - I am feeling the vibration in my back and hip.  I feel I got cheated after buying Camry 2009 model. Anybody over 40 years old, don't buy Camry it is not worth it.  You may get somewhat good mileage but it is going to hurt your health in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"POSITIVE\",\n          \"NEGATIVE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.009045337949025511,\n        \"min\": 0.965612530708313,\n        \"max\": 0.9997826218605042,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9987874627113342,\n          0.9995496869087219\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The buzzing sound occurs when the interior air is trying to sync with the exterior air.   The sound is  louder than a cell phone vibrating and occurs every 5-10 seconds.  We purchased a 2015 Highlander in May 2015 and started hearing the buzzing a week after the purchase.  Replacing the servo motor requires taking apart the dash - an expensive proposition.  Due to the expense, Toyota is taking the position that the noise in \\\"normal\\\" and not under warranty.  Many online forums reflect this issue - search buzzing, noise, servo motor, etc.  Don't forget that the buzzing is loudest when the exterior and interior air are similar.  If you buy the Highlander in the Winter, the buzzing will drive you crazy come Spring.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\",\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.1620813852035471,\n        \"min\": 0.35100260376930237,\n        \"max\": 0.9901902675628662,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3700,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8632768392562866,\n          0.4203464984893799,\n          0.5605929493904114\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The moment I drive this Tacoma home after purchase the CEL goes off. ???  So I go to Auto Zone and it throws the dreaded PO171 lean bank code. So I buy a MAF sensor ( $75.00 )and nothing...code still on. Also noticed that my MPG was awful, getting around 13 mpg for a 18.5 gallon tank. So next I try the 2 Oxygen sensors upstream and downstream ($150) and still nothing, so I'm now thinking this tacoma truck is indeed a [non-permissible content removed] So I take the piece of garbage to the Toyota dealership and they keep the truck for 8 hours on a Saturday !!!!! and tell me truck has the wrong spark plugs and that's causing the PO171 code. $258 later they replace the spark plugs and clear the code and off I go. 8 miles down the road I noticed the piece of crap is misfiring out the tailpipe and CEL comes back on? So after a few more curse words I decide to take it back to dealership the next day and complain. After keeping the garbage truck for 5 hours they now tell me it could be the timing belt was off by a tooth and maybe the fuel injector needs to be replace.....$2,200.00 !!!! Are you fricking kidding me. ROFLMAO. So I take the truck home and the next day when I started, a huge black smoke comes out of tailpipe. Ugh. So I go get timing belt done on my own with a local mechanic and the cost was $500.00 with parts. Drive 4 miles down the road and CEL comes back on ? [non-permissible content removed] So now I replace the Fuel filter and still CEL on. After doing some research I find out that Toyota brand only likes DENSO sensors so I again replaced the 2 Oxygen sensors with DENSO and boom CEL goes off. So I actually drove 250 with NO CEL on but she kept misfiring out the tailpipe and hesitation. So I go and replace the fuel pump and still same issue. And then go after the gaskets and seals and replace them.Now I'm getting ready to dump this piece of garbage out to sea. So a few days later I noticed a funny gas smell coming from  the inside of the engine. What is up, now I have a leaking fuel injector ?? Another $450 to fix. And yep CEL comes back on and this time it's the bad sensor may set a P0401 code (insufficient EGR flow), or it may not set an EGR code but a P0171 and/or P0174 lean code instead. I'm going nuts !!!!! Fix the Fuel injector, reset the computer by disconnecting the battery. So Good riddance you [non-permissible conten removed] tacoma. Toyota got it wrong. DO NOT by a first generation Tacoma at all. Stay away !!!!!! Far away. The worst truck I have bought in my entire life and would not recommend a first generation Tacoma to anyone. GRADE F\",\n          \" I had Corolla for 9 years. I had no problem with that except for its slow pickup and not-good for high speed (over 65) travel. But with Camry I am having back/hip pain because of poor interior design. Gear shift is not smooth, it gets stuck in there. Seating comfort is very poor - I am feeling the vibration in my back and hip.  I feel I got cheated after buying Camry 2009 model. Anybody over 40 years old, don't buy Camry it is not worth it.
